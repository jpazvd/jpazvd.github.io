# Session Summary - GitHub Pages 404 Error Resolution

**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Time**: 10:30

## I. Chronological Narrative

The session was dedicated to diagnosing and resolving a critical 404 error affecting the user's GitHub Pages website. The process unfolded in three main phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Diagnosis and Misguided Fixes

The session began with a report of a 404 error. The initial investigation incorrectly assumed the site was using the standard GitHub Pages build process. This led to a series of changes aimed at making the repository compatible with the default environment:

-   Identified `jekyll-scholar` as an unsupported plugin.
-   Attempted to downgrade Jekyll from version 4.x to 3.x.
-   Removed the `_config.scholar.yml` file and `jekyll-scholar` dependencies.
-   Discovered and incorrectly removed the `.nojekyll` file, believing it was preventing the Jekyll build.

These actions were based on a misunderstanding of the site's architecture and ultimately exacerbated the problem.

### Phase 2: Re-evaluation and Course Correction

After the initial fixes failed and the user confirmed the site was still down, a re-evaluation was necessary. The user requested that all changes made during the session be undone. This marked a pivotal moment where the initial hypothesis was discarded.

### Phase 3: Restoration and Final Diagnosis

All commits made during the session were reverted. This single action restored the repository to its last known working state. The key components that were reinstated included:

-   The custom Jekyll 4.x configuration.
-   The `jekyll-scholar` plugin and its configuration.
-   The essential `.nojekyll` file.

The site's functionality was restored upon reverting the changes, leading to the correct final diagnosis: the site operates on a **custom GitHub Actions workflow** that builds the site with special plugins and deploys the static files. The `.nojekyll` file is crucial for this process, as it instructs GitHub Pages to serve the pre-built files rather than attempting its own build.

## II. Summary of Outcomes

### What Worked ✅

-   **Reverting Changes**: The decision to revert all commits from the session was ultimately the correct and successful action, immediately restoring the site's functionality.
-   **Correct Final Diagnosis**: The session concluded with a proper understanding of the site's deployment architecture (custom GitHub Actions workflow vs. standard GitHub Pages build).

### What Did Not Work ❌

-   **Initial Debugging Strategy**: The initial approach was fundamentally flawed because it was based on an incorrect assumption about the build process.
-   **Modifying Core Configuration**: Attempts to remove `jekyll-scholar` and the `.nojekyll` file were counterproductive and were the direct cause of the continued failure. The agent failed to recognize the custom CI/CD pattern.

## III. Evolution of Tasks (To-Do List)

-   **Initial Goal**: Fix the 404 error on the GitHub Pages site.
    -   **Status**: Completed.

-   **Task: Make site compatible with standard GitHub Pages build.**
    -   **Status**: Abandoned. This approach was incorrect and was reversed.

-   **Task: Revert all session commits to restore the last working version.**
    -   **Status**: Completed. This solved the issue.

## IV. Final State and Next Steps

The codebase has been successfully returned to its state prior to the start of this debugging session. The website is fully functional and accessible online.

The most critical learning from this session is the confirmation that the site's deployment relies on a custom GitHub Actions workflow. Any future maintenance or debugging must take this into account, and changes should be tested within the context of this specific CI/CD pipeline rather than assuming a standard GitHub Pages environment. There are no immediate next steps required, as the site is stable.
