Surprisingly, we found that there has been little public outcry in the region for school systems to act on learning recovery compared to the rest of the world.


    Recently, one of us (Gabriel) spoke with his daughter’s 5thgrade instructor at a local private school outside Bogota, Colombia. Teachers had been optimistic about learning during the pandemic because most students seemed engaged online. But the shocking reality of learning losses became apparent once students were back in classrooms. This is a “best-case” scenario at a well-resourced school, with all the ingredients to make distance learning at least partially effective: high-speed internet, laptops, educated parents, and a well-resourced school.


    For many others, distance education meant little or no learning. Children in Latin America and the Caribbean have felt these costs most acutely, where theyexperienced some of the longest and uninterrupted COVID-19 school closures in the world. On average, students in the region missed one and a half years of learning, with most returning to classrooms in 2022.


    Measuring media attention


    We measured attention given to learning losses and school closures in 18 countries usingMedia Cloud. Media Cloud gathers the full universe of online news sources, which allows us to look at frequency of topic mentions between January 2020 to December 2021 (the reader can explore other periods below), using the terms: “learning loss,” “remote learning,” and “school closure.” We also benchmark the results with “unemployment” and “vaccine.” We interpret the share of mentions of a term to indicate the intensity of public interest in the topic.


    Countries in Latin America have less learning-related media attention compared to the benchmark terms. The share of stories mentioning unemployment or vaccine are similar across countries. School closure was referred to in 0.3% of articles in Latin America, 2.3% in Canada and 3.1% in the United States. Gaps in mentions similarly occur for learning loss and remote learning. Nigeria and South Africa also have relatively more learning-related mentions, so this is not simply a story of country incomes.Figure 1: Media attention to selected education and health topics during the pandemic for selected countries and regions


    Are people less concerned with learning losses in Latin America?


    We interpret these patterns as indicating that school closures and learning losses have generated less public concern in Latin America, at least among media outlets and their readers. Why would that be?


    Private school enrollment in Latin America among highest in the worldand concentrated among the wealthy: 50% of children in the richest quintile are likely to attend a private lower secondary school, compared to 4% among the poorest. Most of the elite and media readership likely send their children to private schools, who were more satisfied with remote learning and experienced shorter school closures. This is one possibility for low coverage of learning losses.


    Figure 2: % Private School Enrollment by Wealth Quintile (PISA 2018)


    A second possibility is that the lack of coverage reflects lower concern in education among Latin American societies, either because families are satisfied with existing resources; or they are not fully aware of the learning crisis’s magnitude. This would match the general observation that Latin Americans express satisfaction with their education systems despite poor performance.


    Globally, we observe that satisfaction with the education sector has some correlation with an objective measure of its quality: the share of children who can read with understanding an age-appropriate text (measured by theLearning Povertyindicator). However, this pattern does not hold in Latin American countries. Countries with the highest learning poverty levels in the region, such as Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala, also have the highest satisfaction with the educational system. Chile, with lowest levels of learning poverty in the region, is also least satisfied with the existing educational system.


    Correlation is not causation. For example, education systems can be better because parents have higher expectations for learning results. However, low learning may be an invisible problem to many parents. Even if parents are aware, access to schools already hugely benefits their children.Figure 3: Correlation between adult population satisfaction with the education system in their country, and Learning Poverty


    Acknowledging the learning crisis


    The combination of what we believe is a lack of public concern for learning losses, and satisfaction with education systems (especially in places with high learning poverty), threatens a dangerous outcome for the COVID generation of students in Latin America. Countries and families – are not discussing learning losses enough in places with lowest pre-pandemic learning levels, which can leave their children further behind.


    There isgrowing alignmentthat learning recovery and acceleration must start with sustained political commitment, along with public support. This first requires acknowledging the extent of the learning crisis, deepened by learning losses. Interest in school closures and remote learning have declined overtime, while attention to learning losses spiked mid-2022. Unfortunately, interest waned again shortly after.


    Figure 4: Media attention over-time in Latin America and the Caribbean


    In Latin America, the presidents of Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Hondurashave expressed commitments to education recovery and acceleration, but governments across the globe have yet to do the same. Recovering learning losses also requires efforts from educators, families, and administrators throughout the system. If education systems return to normal without a shared commitment to recovery, students today will face lifelong consequences.'
  summary: There is now overwhelming evidence that children’s learning plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Latin America. Surprisingly, we found that there has been little public outcry in the region for school systems to act on learning recovery compared to the rest of the world.

  content: 'The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for a long time. The health, social and economic effects on society have been monumental. In 2022, over70 millionadditional people globally were living in poverty on account of the pandemic.


    Other, longer-term effects on well-being have not yet fully materialized. Learning losses associated with school closures and ineffective remote learning have dealt amassive blow to human capital accumulationfor people under the age of 25.


    In our newpaper, we attempt to quantify potential long-run welfare effects of worldwide school closures by simulating their impact on inter-generational mobility. By mapping the estimates of losses in learning-adjusted years of schooling (LAYS) from the latest World Banklearning losses simulationsonto estimates ofinter-generational mobility in education,we find that,in the absence of remedial measures, learning losses are likely to significantly reduce intergenerational mobility in a wide range of countries.


    We focus on intergenerational mobility because it represents a universal human aspiration of parents for a better life for their children, and because it is closely associated with inequalities of opportunity and income in a society.


    Following an earlier report,Fair Progress, we focus on two different measures of mobility:absolute mobility, or the share of children who have more years of education than their parents, andrelative mobility, measured by 1 – COR (where COR is the correlation coefficient between parents’ and children’s years of education), with ahighercorrelation indicating greater persistence or lower relative mobility.


    We find significant negative impacts of school closures on absolute mobility, when learning losses vary across countries but are assumed to be uniform across children within each country. The share of children with more years of education than their parents falls by an average of 9 percentage points for high-income economies and 4 percentage points for developing countries (figure 1).


    Among developing countries, the decline in absolute mobility is largest in upper-middle income countries, at 8 percentage points. The losses are large enough in many cases to reverse past improvements in absolute mobility in lower middle-income countries during the 1960s and 1970s.


    These impacts are consistent with a massive disruption in learning – globally, students are estimated to have lost more than a year of schooling, adjusted for learning. The impact on absolute mobility tends to be larger in higher income countries, because students lose more learning for an equivalent number of days of school closures, where the quality of education is higher.


    Assuming uniform losses within countries leavesrelativemobility measures unchanged. This assumption is however unrealistic since children from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to have access to remote learning.


    To account for this, we take advantage of World Bank-supported high frequency phone surveys for 30 countries. These tell us whether children were learning during school closures, and if so, whether through in-person interactions with teachers or media platforms (such as mobile apps, TV or radio).


    As we cannot observe theeffectivenessof remote learning, we make assumptions about therelativeeffectiveness of different modes of learning — that learning through media platforms is likely to be:


    - more effective than a complete lack of remote learning, and


    - less effective than in-person interactions or completing assignments provided by the teacher; and that


    - all modes of remote learning are less effective than pre-pandemic learning.


    We choose several scenarios that reflect these assumptions to explore the sensitivity of our results to such choices. We then extrapolate from these estimates to the full set of over 150 countries in our sample, assuming similar patterns for countries in the same income group.



    ## Figure 1: Evolution of absolute mobility by birth cohort, with uniform COVID learning losses



    Due to the effect of unequal learning losses within countries, relative mobility is estimated to decline by 2-3 percent in developing countries and 1-4 percent in high-income economies, depending on how effective we believe remote learning to be (figure 2). In upper-middle income countries, where the impacts of learning losses are largest in magnitude, relative mobility could decline by 3-7 percent under different scenarios.



    ## Figure 2: Evolution of relative mobility (1-COR), with COVID impacts under different learning effectiveness scenarios



    These are meaningful impacts, given the slow-moving nature of the relative mobility measure over time. For developing countries overall, the change is equivalent to about 40 percent of the decline in relative mobility between the 1970s and 1980s birth cohorts, and up to 80 percent under more optimistic assumptions about the effectiveness of remote learning.


    Thus, the COVID-19 related school closures could significantly worsen the secular pre-pandemic decline in relative mobility in developing countries. More optimistic assumptions about the effectiveness of remote learning lead to greater impacts on relative mobility, because children from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to have remote learning of any kind than those from more privileged backgrounds.


    The positive news is that the effects estimated here on long-term outcomes are not necessarily inevitable or irreversible.Loss of learning, however distributed, need not become a permanent loss in educational attainment, if the right remedial measures are taken in time.


    Yet, the window of opportunity is limited, and the more delayed these interventions are, the more costly and less effective they are likely to be to recover the learning losses. We must not minimize or lose sight of the urgency of addressing such longer-term risks, if society is to truly meet parents’ aspirations for a better life for their children.'
  summary: In the absence of remedial measures, learning losses are likely to significantly reduce intergenerational mobility in a wide range of countries.

  content: 'In our recentThe State of the Global Education Crisis: A Path to Recoveryreport (produced jointly by UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank), we sounded the alarm: this generation of students now risks losing $17 trillion in lifetime earnings in present value, or about 14 percent of today’s global GDP, because of COVID-19-related school closures and economic shocks. This new projection far exceeds the $10 trillion estimate released in 2020 and reveals that the impact of the pandemic is more severe thanpreviously thought.


    The pandemic and school closures not only jeopardized children’s health and safety with domestic violence and child labor increasing, but also impacted student learning substantially. The report indicates that in low- and middle-income countries, the share of children living inLearning Poverty– already above 50 percent before the pandemic – could reach 70 percent largely as a result of the long school closures and the relative ineffectiveness of remote learning.


    Unless action is taken, learning losses may continue to accumulate once children are back in school, endangering future learning.


    Figure 1. Countries must accelerate learning recovery


    Severe learning losses and worsening inequalities in education


    Results from global simulations of the effect of school closures on learning are now being corroborated by country estimates of actual learning losses. Evidence fromBrazil,rural Pakistan,rural India,South Africa, andMexico, among others, shows substantial losses in math and reading. In some low- and middle-income countries, on average, learning losses are roughly proportional to the length of the closures—meaning that each month of school closures led to a full month of learning losses (Figure 1, selected LMICs and HICs presents an average effect of 100% and 43%, respectively), despite the best efforts of decision makers, educators, and families to maintain continuity of learning.


    However, the extent of learning loss varies substantially across countries and within countries by subject, students’ socioeconomic status, gender, and age or grade level (Figure 1 illustrates this point, note the large standard deviation, a measure which shows data are spread out far from the mean). For example, results from two states in Mexico show significant learning losses in reading and in math for students aged 10-15. The estimated learning losses were greater in math than reading, and they disproportionately affected younger learners, students from low-income backgrounds, and girls.


    Figure 2. The average learning loss standardized by the length of the school closure was close to 100% in Low- and Middle-Income countries, and 43% in High-Income countries, with a standard deviation of 74% and 30%, respectively.


    While most countries have yet to measure learning losses, data from several countries, combined with more extensive evidence on unequal access to remote learning and at-home support, shows the crisis has exacerbated inequalities in education globally.


    - Children from low-income households, children with disabilities, and girls were less likely to access remote learning due to limited availability of electricity, connectivity, devices, accessible technologies as well as discrimination and social and gender norms.


    - Younger students had less access to age-appropriate remote learning and were more affected by learning loss than older students. Pre-school-age children, who are at a pivotal stage for learning and development, faced a double disadvantage as they were often left out of remote learning and school reopening plans.


    - Learning losses were greater for students of lower socioeconomic status in various countries, includingGhana,Mexico, andPakistan.


    - While the gendered impact of school closures on learning is still emerging, initial evidence points to larger learning losses among girls, including inSouth AfricaandMexico.


    As a result, these children risk missing out on much of the boost that schools and learning can provide to their well-being and life chances. The learning recovery response must therefore target support to those that need it most, to prevent growing inequalities in education.


    Beyond learning, growing evidence shows the negative effects school closures have had on students’ mental health and well-being, health and nutrition, and protection, reinforcing the vital role schools play in providing comprehensive support and services to students.


    Critical and Urgent Need to Focus on Learning Recovery


    How should decision makers and the international community respond to the growing global education crisis?


    Reopening schools and keeping them open must be the top priority, globally. While nearly every country in the world offered remote learning opportunities for students, the quality and reach of such initiatives varied, and in most cases, they offered a poor substitute for in-person instruction. Stemming and reversing learning losses, especially for the most vulnerable students, requires in-person schooling. Decision makers need to reassure parents and caregivers that with adequate safety measures, such as social distancing, masking, and improved ventilation, global evidence shows that children can resume in-person schooling safely.


    But just reopening schools with a business-as-usual approach won’t reverse learning losses. Countries need to createLearning Recovery Programs. Three lines of action will be crucial:


    - Consolidating the curriculum– to help teachers prioritize essential material that students have missed while out of school, even if the content is usually covered in earlier grades, to ensure the curriculum is aligned to students’ learning levels. As an example,Tanzaniaconsolidated its curriculum for grade 1 and 2 in 2015, reducing the number of subjects taught and increasing time on ensuring the acquisition of foundational numeracy and literacy.


    - Extending instructional time– by extending the school day, modifying the academic calendar to make the school year longer, or by offering summer school for all students or those in need. InMexico, the Ministry of Public Education announced planned extensions to the academic calendar to help recovery. InMadagascar, the government scaled up an existing two-month summer “catch-up” program for students who reintegrate into school after having left the system.


    - Improving the efficiency of learning– by supporting teachers to apply structured pedagogy and targeted instruction. A structured pedagogy intervention inKenyausing teachers guides with lesson plans has proven to be highly effective. Targeted instruction, or aligning instruction to students’ learning level, has been successfully implemented at scale inCote D’Ivoire.


    Finally, the report emphasizes the need for adequate funding. As of June 2021, the education and training sector had been allocated less than 3 percent of global stimulus packages. Much more funding will be needed for immediate learning recovery if countries are to avert the long-term damage to productivity and inclusion that they now face.


    Learning Recovery as a Springboard to an Accelerated Learning Trajectory


    Accelerating learning recovery has benefits that go well beyond short-term gains:  it can give children the necessary foundations for a lifetime of learning, and it can help countries increase the efficiency, equity, and resilience of schooling. This can be achieved if countries build on investments made and lessons learned during the crisis—most notably, with a focus on six areas:


    - Assessing student learning so instruction can be targeted to students’ learning levels and specific needs.


    - Investing in digital learning opportunities for all students, ensuring that technology is fit for purpose and focused on enhancing human interactions.


    - Reinforcing support that leverages the role of parents, families, and communities in children’s learning.


    - Ensuring that teachers are supported and have access to practical, high-quality professional development opportunities, teaching guides and learning materials.


    - Increasing the share of education in the national budget allocation of stimulus packages and tying it to investments mentioned above that can accelerate learning.


    - Investing in evidence building - in particular, implementation research, to understand what works and how to scale what works to the system level.


    It is time to shift from crisis response to learning recovery. We must make sure that investments and actions for learning recovery lay the foundations for more efficient, equitable, and resilient education systems—systems that truly deliver learning and well-being for all children and youth. Only then can we ensure learning continuity in the face of future disruption.


    The report was produced as part of theMission: Recovering Education 2021, through which theWorld Bank,UNESCO, andUNICEFare focused on three priorities: bringing all children back to schools, recovering learning losses, and preparing and supporting teachers.'

  content: 'Since early 2020 education systems around the world have rolled out emergency remote learning strategies at an unprecedented scale. What have the past eighteen months taught policymakers and practitioners about the delivery, take-up and effectiveness of remote learning? How can these lessons guide plans for the months and years ahead? Anew reportoffers answers to these questions. If short on time, you may check out ourpodcastinstead. Although the pandemic is still disrupting education globally, and its long-term consequences are yet to be seen, this report highlights emerging trends and challenges that can inform country efforts to build back better.


    The report proposes a conceptual framework that remote learning requires three complementary elements:effective teachers,suitable technology, andengaged learners. These three elements must be well-aligned if remote learning is to be taken-up and be effective (Figure 1). A teacher with high subject content knowledge, technical skills to use technology and supporting resources, and appropriate pedagogical techniques is likely to be more effective at remote learning than a teacher without one or more of these qualities. Similarly, the availability of technology is a necessary but not sufficient condition for effective remote learning, as technology needs to be suited to the context in which it is deployed.Effective remote learningalso requires an engaged user, whose engagement depends on motivation, teacher and technology effectiveness, as well as contextual factors such as their home environment.


    Figure 1Conceptual Framework for Remote Learning During COVID-19


    Source:Remote Learning During COVID-19: Lessons from Today, Principles for Tomorrow report


    Governments tried an array of approaches to tackle school closures and deliver remote learning


    Governments deployed remote learning in a variety of ways. Some governments provided multiple options for students to access remote learning, others offered a single option. Often, countries took advantage of preexisting education technology infrastructure to deploy remote learning strategies ranging from paper-based take-home packages toradio, TV,phone, and internet-based solutions. Regardless of which approach countries have taken,remote learning strategies have variedin terms of design, usage, and contextual features.


    Governments tried to facilitate use of remote learning in multiple ways. Some partnered with the private sector and/or delivered targeted aid directly to households to facilitate children’s access to remote learning. Others went as far as subsidizing individual tutoring. A number of countries adjusted curricula to accommodate the reduction in school days. Some provided teachers with remote training. Others are providing disadvantaged groups with improved access to remote learning infrastructure – by offering learning materials in minority languages or gearing content towards children with disabilities, or by introducing flexible and self-paced platforms.


    Not all approaches were successful in reaching students or delivering learning


    Many struggled to ensure participation and some found themselves in aremote learning paradox: having chosen a distance learning approach that was unsuited to local circumstances. For example, some governments provided online (digital) learning solutions, even though most of their students could not access those solutions due to lack of devices or connectivity constraints. This resulted in uneven use or even exacerbated existing inequalities.


    Some approaches exacerbated inequalities


    What once was a digital divide for some is now a digital chasm for many. Even before the pandemic, access to technology, and the resources and skills needed to utilize it effectively differed widely within and across countries. Parental engagement and support, critical to remote learning, also vary by education and socio-economic background. Household income losses during the pandemic have only deepened these divides. Marginalized children and vulnerable groups, such as girls, students with disabilities and ethnic minorities, are likely to have been disproportionately affected and are at greater risk of falling further behind.


    Consequently, the effectiveness of remote learning in this period varied widely


    The evidence on the effectiveness of remote learning during COVID-19 is mixed. When compared to in-person learning prior to the pandemic, learning outcomes after remote learning were often low. In low-income countries remote learning was not as widely utilized as in middle-income countries. Consequently, the evidence on the effectiveness of remote learning in these settings is sparse. Even in some high-income settings where take-up was high, evidence suggests that the effectiveness of remote learning during COVID has been low.


    Lessons from today, principles for tomorrow


    The last eighteen months have provided several lessons that can serve as principles for tomorrow. Here are five that seem particularly relevant for policymakers seeking to build back better:


    - Establish meaningful two-way interactions.Using the most appropriate technology for the local context along with adjusted curriculum, is critical for enabling effective engagement between students and teachers.


    - Ensure remote learning is fit-for-purpose.When deciding on modes of remote learning, countries must account for access and utilization of technology among both teachers and students including digital skills. Policy makers must also ensure thatteachers have access and opportunities to develop the technical and pedagogical competencies needed for teaching remotely.


    - Engage and support parents and students as partners in the teaching and learning process.Given the isolation and disconnection caused by school closures,it is imperative that families are engagedand supported to help students access remote learning opportunities and to ensure both continuity of learning and protection of socioemotional well-being.


    - Socioemotional support is urgent for teachers, students, and parents:Remote learning strategies cannot be simply limited to a supply of lessons and contents. A comprehensive strategy isrequired for socioemotional monitoring and psychosocialsupport to ensure well-being and avoid burnout.


    - Remedial and accelerated learning programs need to be carefully implemented and monitored:Even though most countries have planned to or are already implementing programs to support students in catching up, remedial programs should be carefully implemented, not only by identifying the areas in which students need more support, but also by constantly monitoring how students are progressing.

  content: 'In October 2019, the World Bank and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) launched a new metric,Learning Poverty, which highlighted that 53% of all children in low- and middle-income countries were not able to read an age-appropriate text with comprehension by age 10 (Figure 1). This figure included those who were tested in schools and found unable to read with comprehension an age-appropriate text, along with out-of-school children. Because schools have numerous other functions that contribute to children’s health and well-being —such as promoting safety, nutrition, and socialization, and facilitating parents'' labor market participation—and at the macro level schooling can help build social cohesion, democracy, and peace. All those complementary functions mean that schooling has value over and above the measured cognitive learning that it leads to, and they justify including schooling deprivation in the concept of learning poverty. The new metric is already focusing action
    to turn the tide on low levels of reading comprehension. It’s being used to rally the international community to prevent a lost generation of children (inthis callby dozens of world leaders, through theSave Our Future initiative), and to motivate the tracking of COVID’s impact on education (e.g., in the Joint Survey carried out withUNESCO, UNICEF, and OECDanda new collaborationwith UNICEF and Johns Hopkins). It is also helping to explain the need to focus on foundational learning (e.g., by theseglobalandnationalfoundations).  In anew paper, Will Every Child Be Able to Read by 2030?, we provide the full technical background and main results for the learning poverty metric, together with robustness tests, heterogeneity analysis, tests of external validity, and extensions.

    Why did the Bank and the UIS create the learning poverty measure, and what have we learned so far about the progress the world is making toward ending learning poverty?  First, the rationale. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which every UN member signed onto in 2015, embody high global aspirations for education.SDG 4makes this commitment: by 2030, the signatories will “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” The various targets under this goal cover the educational landscape, starting with universal access to quality ECD and preschool and extending to equal access to affordable university education. But the very first of these commitments is Target 4.1, which is to “ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.” In other words, the world has committed to achieve universal completion of both primary and secondary
    school for all youth — and with meaningful learning — by 2030. However, given the depth of thelearning crisisin many low- and middle-income countries and the observed rate of progress in the recent past, we show this target isnot feasible. A target has to be ambitious, but it must also be attainable. Otherwise, it is useless as a motivator to propel the required actions. This was true even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and it is even more so now, as the school closures and global recession triggered by the pandemicinterrupt student learning and reduce attachment to schooling.


    The learning poverty metric is designed to spotlight two fundamental challenges at the core of theSDG 4 aspirations:  ensuring that all children can read by age 10 with at least a minimum level of comprehension (SDG 4.1.1b) and that all children are enrolled in school (SDG 4.1.4). This simple learning poverty indicator can resonate with any stakeholder—parent, educator, community leader, employer, politician—and it is also technically sound. Ensuring that all students are in school and reading with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading (Figure 2). Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  A target of “every child reading by age 10” is a fair
    development objective. All children reading is a human right. The rate of learning poverty should be zero—just as the rate of extreme monetary poverty or hunger should. In high-income countries, the learning poverty rate is 10%, with only a small share not learning to learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school; and for the highest-performing countries, the figure is 3% or less. While it may take decades to build up an entire high-quality education system, ensuring that all primary school-age children are attending schools which can teach children to reach a minimum proficiency in reading should require much less time. Reading proficiency can serve as a good proxy for (contemporaneous) foundational learning in other subjects, particularly at the level of the educational system. This indicator help focuses attention on equity. To eliminate learning poverty, countries have to give all children good foundational skills; they can’t just try to improve the mean by focusing
    on the elite students.  This broad foundation of skills sets up the entire cohort for success in secondary school and beyond. Finally, the learning poverty measure is more responsive to targeted policy interventions than other measures such as the Learning Adjusted Years of schooling (LAYS). It is easier to make tangible short-term progress on Learning Poverty, because it requires improving only the learning and schooling of the youngest cohort, and we have proven techniques for doing that.  This is a key step toward the crucial longer-run goal of increasing LAYS.


    Figure 2. Learning Poverty vs. Learning Deprivation (share of students below min. proficiency) in secondary school, for 25 LICs and MICs


    To develop the learning poverty estimates, we combine data from 100 countries that account for 81% of children worldwide and 80% of children in low- and middle-income countries, using internationally comparable learning thresholds produced by theGlobal Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), which is led by the UIS. The results of that effort, documented in detail inour working paperand summarized briefly inWorld Bank (2019), are sobering:


    - More than half of children in low- and middle-income countries have not achieved minimum levels of proficiency in reading by age 10, or in most cases by the end of primary.  An estimated 53% of children at or near the end of primary school age are not yet able to read a short, age-appropriate story with comprehension.


    - At the rates of progress seen so far this century, the goal of ensuring that all children can read by 2030—in other words, reducing the rate of learning poverty to zero—is far out of reach.  While the share of children who are “learning-poor” has been declining, the pace of progress is far too slow to ensure that all children will be able to read by 2030.  We estimate that under a “business as usual” scenario —that is, with progress at the rate we saw during 2000-17—44% of children in 2030 will still be unable to read at age 10.  This indicator is an early warning that all the education-related SDGs are in jeopardy, and that grounding aspirations requires a more plausible medium-term target.


    - Even if countries reduce their learning poverty at the fastest rates we have seen in recent decades, the world will not come close to attaining the “every child reading” goal by 2030.  If every country were to reduce learning poverty like the top performers over the 2000-15 period—meaning that they matched the rates achieved by countries at the 80th percentile of the regional distribution of gains—the global learning poverty rate can be reduced from 53% in 2015 only to 27% in 2030.  Stated differently, if every low- and middle-income country ramped up its efforts to address learning poverty and doubled or tripled its historical rate of progress, it would be possible to cut the global learning poverty rate in low- and middle- income countries by nearly half.  In October 2019, the World Bank announced a corporate commitment to support countries to “by 2030, reduce by at least half the share of children in low- and middle- income countries who cannot read by age 10.” The goal of this
    target was to promote tangible progress toward the SDGs and improved Human Capital, by focusing on medium-term learning goals and immediate action to improve foundational skills. Our analysis shows that this intermediate goal was already highly ambitious when announced, requiring a global rate of progress to increase nearly triple its 2000-2017 rate.


    All of these findings are based on data from before the COVID-19 pandemic—meaning that the situation is now even worse than indicated by these estimates. While the data sources used in this analysis are not yet available for 2020, nor will they be available for at least another year or two, there is no question that the levels of learning poverty are now higher, and the recent trends worse than reported here. Initial simulations suggest that in a pessimistic scenario, learning poverty in low- and middle-income countries could increase from53% to 63% due to COVID-19. Theeffects of COVID will make the learning target even harder to achieve, but they also underline how important it is to have a summary indicator like learning poverty.  By keeping our eyes on that indicator, together we can build more effective and equitable basic education systems in the wake of the crisis.'

    Our choice of a measure shapes our understanding of the size and nature of a problem. In arecent blogwe discuss why the learning poverty measure is well suited to monitor the educational impacts of COVID-19. In this blog, we discuss two complementary concepts: the learning poverty gap and learning poverty severity, to look at distributions among the learning poor and measure how these changes affect learning inequality. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and the World Bank provide data for both of these concepts. Data for many key SDG 4 indicators were updated in the March data refresh. The UIS is also collecting data on the national response to COVID-19 oneducation, equity and inclusion.


    Understanding changes in learning inequality through the learning poverty gap, learning poverty severity and minimum proficiency


    Whilelearning poverty is a simple concept to grasp, this indicator alone does not provide a picture of the learning level and distribution of learning among those below the minimum proficiency level (MPL). Because learning poverty is a headcount ratio, estimates treat all students below the minimum proficiency level as being equally learning deprived. It also does not reflect improvements in learning below the MPL threshold, which can fail to create compatible incentives as it may miss progress in foundational subskills critical for developing reading proficiency, for example, knowledge of spoken words and how to use them, hearing and making the sounds of words, mapping sounds to letters and letters to sounds while learning letter names, among others, as described in the reading rainbow (Figure 1). Understanding the heterogeneity among the learning poor is critical to combat learning poverty as children who do not master these subskills in early primary grades remain unable to read with
    comprehension.


    Figure 1:  SDG4.1 framework and reading rainbow of literacy subskills


    In order to capture changes below the MPL, one can extend the learning poverty measure to a more general class of inequality sensitive indicators, as discussed during the seventhGAMLandTCGmeetings. We examine the desired attributes of this proposed measures and some of their axiomatic properties in a recent paper. In this blog we summarize some of the main motivations for this broader family of learning poverty measures, and illustrate its value based on two specific cases that are sensitive to the distribution of learning and the potential inequity among the kids below the minimum proficiency level, namely,learning poverty gap (α=1)andlearning poverty severity (α=2)(Figure 2).


    Figure 2:  Distributional sensitive measure of learning deprivation


    Some of the main justifications for this choice are:


    - First, the world faces a learning crisis,with 53% of 10-year-olds unable to read and understand a simple age-appropriate text. In low-income countries, the learning poverty headcount ratio approaches 90%. In this context, it is critical to use a measure that can differentiate the magnitude of the learning crisis, by looking at both the learning poverty rate and learning poverty gap and to be able to recommend sound policy solutions.


    - Second, if two educational systems have the same learning poverty rate, the one with the lower level of learning among those below the MPL should be considered worse off, other things being equal.


    - Third, learning is a cumulative and progressive process, and a good measure should be able to capture changes in foundational learning, which take place at lower levels of the learning scale. Such sensitivity can help policymakers prioritize foundational learning and help capture the progress that education systems are achieving from investments in foundational skills.


    - Fourth, there is overwhelming evidence thatteaching at a level too high for students’ proficiency has a detrimental effect on how much they learn, so a good measure should be able to take students’ initial knowledge into consideration.


    - Fifth, a distribution-sensitive measure captures an important dimension of the complexity of the problem: unequal distribution of learning among the poor. The greater the inequality of the learning poverty gap, the more flexible the education system must be to both identify students‘ needs and offer appropriate learning opportunities. Understanding such heterogeneity can be of critical importance to plan lessons and/or design Teaching at the Right Level interventions.


    Other justifications for using distribution-sensitive measures can be grounded on egalitarian preferences for society. This assumes that given a choice between improving learning poverty of two children by the same amount, society’s preference will be for helping the one who is worse off. Several arguments can support this value judgment, such as the diminishing marginal value of literacy and the importance of social cohesion but also economic growth.


    Are the complementary but different measures of learning poverty level, gap, and severity empirically relevant?The extent depends on the prevalence of countries with:


    - thesamelearning poverty level butdifferentlearning poverty gaps (Figure 2, panel A), or


    - thesamelearning poverty gaps butdifferentlearning poverty severity (Figure 2, panel B).


    Figure 3 illustrates those points using the latest available data from 99 countries in thelearning poverty database where the learning poverty gap and learning poverty severity indicators are available. The figure shows a wide range of learning poverty gaps among the poor in countries with similar levels of learning poverty (panel A). Several countries have around 70% learning poverty, including the Philippines and Nicaragua, but the learning poverty gap among the poor in the Philippines is almost three times the size of the gap in Nicaragua. This suggests that the effort required to tackle learning poverty in the Philippines might be larger than in Nicaragua.


    But this is not the whole story. It’s also important to look at inequality or learning poverty severity. For example, learning poverty severity in Nicaragua is almost 10 times what it is in the Philippines, suggesting a far greater level of heterogeneity among the learning poor students in Nicaragua. This finding illustrates the empirical relevance of the distinction between measures of learning poverty level, gap, and severity and the importance of clarity on which of the three measures might be the most relevant when analyzing different situations. As a result, policies to reduce learning poverty could differ considerably if the levels of the learning poverty gap or learning poverty severity are drastically different.


    Countries with the same level of learning poverty but a higher learning poverty gap will need a far greater effort to bring children above the MPL. At the same time, countries with the same learning poverty gap but different learning poverty severity will need far greater flexibility in learning (and schooling) strategies to better align their education systems with student needs.


    They can accomplish this by setting clear goals, through instructional coherence, teacher support and contextual salience.


    Figure 3. Relationships between learning poverty, the learning poverty gap, learning poverty severity, the learning deprivation gap, and the learning severity gap


    As school systems reopen after extended closures due to COVID-19, it will be critical to meet students where they are and to monitor changes in the learning distribution among the poor, given that evidence suggests that asignificant source of inequality is within groups. To measure and track the problem of within-group inequality, learning poverty severity is the appropriate measure. The relevance and usefulness of these complementary measures are clear from numerical, empirical, and policy perspectives.'
  summary: As school systems reopen after extended closures due to COVID-19, it will be critical to meet students where they are and to monitor changes in the learning distribution among the poor, given that evidence suggests that a significant source of inequality is within groups.

    Most governments and development partners are working on identifying, protecting, and supporting learning of the most vulnerable members of the COVID-19 generation. In this blog, we examine how the SDG 4.1.1 framework and the concept of learning poverty are well positioned to help countries understand and act on the impacts of COVID-19 on schooling and learning.


    From the minimum proficiency level to a measure of learning deprivation


    In October 2018, the international community agreed to be deliberate about tracking progress in learning of students using a global standard. The minimum proficiency level (MPL)­ agreed through the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning offers a unique benchmark to help countries and development partners work together to monitor and improve learning for these students that are falling behind. The interactive visualization linked to in the image below (Figure 1) allows you to explore the data used to monitor this SDG, using both the GAML MPL as well as different minimum proficiency levels by interacting with the slider.


    Figure 1 shows how SDG 4.1.1. can be used to generate focus on students below the minimum proficiency level (MPL)


    Learning poverty: a multidimensional indicator for the education sector


    In October 2019, the World Bank and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) launched a new multidimensional indicator called learning poverty. It is based on the notion that every child should be in school and be able to read an age-appropriate text by age 10.[1] This formulation reflects the aspiration and serves as an early warning indicator of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 that all children must be in school and learning[2] and builds on two deprivations.


    Learning poverty (and Indicator 4.1.1 on learning deprivation) has many desirable characteristics, including simplicity and focus on those in the bottom of the learning distribution (for a longer discussion on some of the properties of the learning poverty measure please see a recent paper). It brings together schooling and learning indicators, as it combines the share of primary-aged children out-of-school who are schooling deprived (SD), and the share of pupils below a minimum proficiency in reading, who are learning deprived (LD). This measure implies that both “more schooling”, which by itself serves a variety of critical societal functions, as well as “better learning” which is important to ensure that time spent in school translates into acquisition of skills and capabilities.


    Figure 2 provides an animation which numerically and visually illustrates the concept of learning poverty


    The learning poverty indicator is calculated as follows:


    LP = [LD x (1-SD)] + [1 x SD]


    LD= Learning deprivation, defined as share of children at the end of primary who read at below the minimum proficiency level, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) in the context of the SDG 4.1.1 monitoring


    SD= Schooling deprivation, defined as the share of primary aged children who are out-of-school. All out-of-school children are assumed to be below the minimum proficiency level in reading.


    By construction, learning poverty can be affected by changes in its two dimensions: (i) learning deprivation as the share of students below the minimum proficiency threshold improves or worsens, or (ii) schooling deprivation as access or age-grade distortion changes due to shocks or policies.


    While schooling deprivation can be directly observed depending on whether the child is enrolled or not enrolled in school, learning deprivation cannot be directly observed, and is measured through standardized learning assessments using SDG’s definition of minimum proficiency level, where reading proficiency is defined as:


    “Students independently and fluently read simple, short narrative and expository texts. They locate explicitly stated information. They interpret and give some explanations about the key ideas in these texts. They provide simple, personal opinions or judgements about the information, events and characters in a text.” (UIS and GAML 2019)


    SDG 4.1.1, learning poverty and COVID-19


    The SDG 4.1.1 framework and the learning poverty measure can help monitor and guide national conversations on the impacts and education policy response to COVID-19 by:


    Reaching agreement and clarity on a minimum proficiency level:The GAML process, through the Global Proficiency Framework, has produced detailed documentation about the competences expected to be mastered at the minimum proficiency level (MPL). All this material can be used to inform a national conversation on what elements of the curriculum could be prioritized as the system reopens.


    Focus on children falling behind:SDG 4.1.1 uses the MPL to measure the share of students above this threshold reflecting the aspiration that all children must be performing above the MPL. However, during a time of crisis and shock, such as COVID-19, countries might want to pay special attention to those students left behind. The latter is precisely what the measure of learning deprivation used in the learning poverty measure does.


    Monitoring multiple dimensions of education:As schools close, students will lose learning. However, for certain sub-populations, COVID-19 might push students out of the educational system, increasing drop-out rates; and in certain countries, due to a choice of policies and practices, might increase repetition and age-grade distortion. Moreover, if school deprivation increases, through an increase of drop-out or of the age-grade distortion of previously low-performing students, it is statistically possible that average learning scores might increase or at least not fall as much after COVID-19. This misleading result can be avoided if effects are monitored using a measure which is simultaneously sensitive to changes in learning and access to schooling.


    COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented crisis within an already existing global crisis of the education system in the developing world. The ability to use it as an opportunity to build back better will depend on the quality of our understanding of its effects. For that, both data and our choice of measures will be equally critical.


    [2] SDG 4 makes this commitment: by 2030, signatories will “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” The goal’s target 4.1 is to “ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.”'
  summary: Most governments and development partners are working on identifying, protecting, and supporting learning of the most vulnerable members of the COVID-19 generation.

  content: 'The Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) has an ambitious agenda to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. To fulfill this commitment and track progress, accurate measures of learning outcomes are essential. Thanks to theGlobal Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), there is a consensus of how minimum standards for learning map into the scales of international, regional, and national learning assessments.


    A handful of countries such as China, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, and Uganda currently use their national assessments to report on the SDGs. Like Brazil, other countries report on the SDGs using solely international or regional assessments (i.e., LLECE for early grade and primary, and PISA for lower secondary). Nevertheless, Brazil has a biannual census-based national learning assessment used to monitor learning systematically through the Index of Basic Education Quality (IDEB), an index which factors the average score as a measure of education quality.


    The coexistence of national and international assessments and different metrics to track an educational system''s performance begs the three questions addressed in this blog: (1) How do learning outcomes compare across assessments? (2) How can national and international assessments be aligned? (3) How much the choice of indicator matter?


    1.    Comparing the national and international pictures


    Comparing two learning assessments is challenging even if they intend to measure the same content and student population. In psychometrics, this challenge is known as linking. It is like comparing two pictures of the same forest, taken days apart, using different lens, speed, light, and film sensitivity (yes, some of us are old enough to remember film ISO). The picture''s timing mirrors pupils being assessed at different grades or moments of the school year. Sampling in each assessment, akin to a film sensitivity, can give a more or less precise image of learning and limit our ability to zoom into the picture. Lastly, each assessment has its own scale for measuring proficiency, just like a wide-angle lens captures a broad scope while a telephoto lens allows the photographers to hone in the details of a narrow area. All these factors combined can create contrasting compositions by highlighting distinct aspects of the same subject.


    Let''s take this analogy to the Brazilian case and compare learning outcomes in reading and mathematics using national and international assessments. To minimize the difference in the pictures'' timing, we select the closest match of years and grades. At the end of primary, we compare  the 2013 regional assessment of 6th graders and the national assessment of 5th graders. At lower secondary, we look at PISA 2015 assessment of 15 years-old and the national learning assessment (NLA) 2015 assessment of 9th graders. The resolutions (or film sensitivity) differ significantly: LLECE and PISA are sample-based and evaluated a few thousand pupils each, while the NLA tested close to 2 million pupils in each grade. Lastly, we need minimum proficiency thresholds. For LLECE and PISA, we rely on the GAML consensus. For the NLA, we use the national advocacy threshold proposed byexperts convened in 2006 by "Todos pela Educação".


    How do these pictures of learning in Brazil compare? Figure 1 illustrates our findings. Each bar represents students'' share by level, with pupils below the minimum proficiency in orange and above in blue (each shade corresponding to a proficiency level). The share of students below the minimum proficiency in the national assessment is consistently lower, possibly because: (i) pupils are tested at earlier grades in the national exam; (ii) the national aspirational level might be more ambitious than the international one; or, (iii) the scales are not necessarily comparable.

    Note: for details on the proficiency levels of each assessment available, please seeLLECE,NLA-SAEB,PISA


    2.    Aligning scales of national and international assessments


    One of the GAML process''s biggest contributions was shifting the conversation from a common scale (requiring that all countries implemented the same assessment to have a global number) to aGlobal Proficiency Framework, which describescompetenciesthat students should master to be considered proficient at each grade. This means different assessments of sufficient quality can be used as long as they can be benchmarked against this international standard. Though less precise, this approach has the benefit of building on assessment systems that already exist and can increase the country ownership of the results (another critical objective in the SDGs).  GAML experts undertook the Herculean task of mapping the proficiency levels of several international (i.e., PISA, PIRLS) and regional (i.e., LLECE, SAQMEC, PASEC) learning assessments in a continuum and identify the minimum proficiency levels at early grade, end of primary, and lower secondary.


    As mentioned before, some countries have chosen to report their SDGs using their national learning assessment. This has the advantage of increasing the national ownership of the measure and allowing countries to compare their own national aspirations with international standards easily. The mapping to a global scale can be a valuable complement for triangulation and identifying countries to learn from and benchmark.


    However, to be valid, it is critical to go beyond an empirical validation, as done in this blog, and explore more suitable methods to map the scale of a national assessment to the Global Proficiency Framework. As discussed in thelatest GAML meeting, which took place in October 2020, countries can do this through:


    1.    The inclusion ofglobal itemsin the national learning assessments which can then be used to psychometrically link the two scales;2.    AnUIS/IEA Rosetta Stone approach(paper) such as what theLaboratorio de UNESCO/UIS/IEA are pilotingin Colombia and Guatemala to link the LLECE scale with the PIRLS scale by applying both assessments to the same group of students; or3.    Apolicy linking workshopwhere experts from the national and international assessment map the minimum passing scores on both assessments (policy linking update presented in the 7th GAML meeting).


    3. How much does the choice of indicator matters?


    Brazil has an impressive education monitoring system – besides assessing students'' learning, it tracks individual schooling trajectories through a School Census. More importantly, there is ownership and accountability of education indicators, with the composite Index of Basic Education Quality (IDEB) being widely reported in the national media and actively used to inform policy. The IDEB of each cycle (primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary) is the product of the average reading and mathematics test scores for the final grade in the cycle and the average pass rate for the cycle.


    The SDG target 4.1 has a dual commitment with schooling and learning, similar in spirit to the IDEB. However, learning is monitored through the share of students achieving a minimum proficiency level rather than by average scores. Pupils'' proficiency can be combined with out-of-school rates, so all children count, as done in thelearning povertyindicator. This reflects a commitment to focus our efforts on improving learning for the kids that fail to reach these minimum standards of competencies.


    Currently, the IDEB is the leading metric for benchmarking municipal and state systems'' performance within Brazil, but what are its blind spots? With recent initiatives to revise this indicator, it is vital to reflect on the country''s aspirations for education and how they translate into measures.


    The IDEB uses the average test score, which can hide many important aspects of the improvement of education quality. As Figure 2 illustrates, the mean score and the share of students below the national benchmark minimum proficiency level do not move at the same speed. For example, students who cannot read proficiently at the end of primary almost halved (from 72% to 39%) between 2007 and 2019, while the mean scores increased only 22%. You can interact with this dashboard to visualize other years, grades, and subjects. This happens because changes in proficiency levels are driven both by changes in the mean score and the learning distribution (seeanother blogthat dives deeper on this point using PISA data).


    Figure 2 – Evolution of mean scores and share of students below minimum proficiency


    Learning performance can also improve when the proportion of students participating of the learning assessments is reduced  (sometimes intentionally) to exclude the low-performing students. IDEB mitigates this type of selection (at least at the school level) that could artificially inflate the average learning, as it is only reported for schools with a participation rate (ratio between the students that are assessed and the total number of students enrolled) above 80%. IDEB also considers the progression rate of students throughout the entire  education cycle, discouraging the automatic promotion of children who are not learning while also discouraging grade retention to boost test scores.


    Going forward, IDEB can be improved. Accountability can be higher if the participation rate enters the formula as a reduction factor, rather than a criterion for IDEB being reported or not. IDEB could also more effectively capture the efforts to increase equity and access by also considering completion rates and/or access rates, as a substantial proportion of dropouts happens between grades (or school years). All those choices can help strengthen the incentives generated by IDEB.Measuring learning is a key part of evidence-based education policy, and the choices of measures matter. Educational systems that want to adopt a performance metric sensitive to learning inequalities should not rely on average scores. The focus on students at the bottom of the learning distribution is the first step toward a greater commitment to equity.

  content: 'O Objetivo de Desenvolvimento Sustentável 4 (ODS 4), estabelecido no contexto da Agenda 2030, define  como meta assegurar uma educação de qualidade inclusiva e equitativa e promover oportunidades de aprendizagem ao longo da vida para todos. Para monitorar o progresso e cumprimento deste compromisso, é essencial fazer uso de medidas precisas dos resultados de aprendizagem. Graças àAliança Global para Monitorar Aprendizado(GAML, em inglês), foi construído um consenso sobre os padrões mínimos internacionais para medir o aprendizado em diferentes séries e disciplinas, com valores correspondentes nas escalas de avaliações de aprendizagem nacionais e internacionais.


    Alguns países como a China, Etiópia, Índia, Paquistão e Uganda usam atualmente suas avaliações nacionais para reportar seus indicadores dos ODS 4. Outros países, como o Brasil, reportam seus indicadores ODS usando exclusivamente avaliações internacionais ou regionais; mais precisamente, as avaliaçõesLLECE, para anos iniciais do ensino fundamental, ePISA, para os anos finais do sistema educacional. Além disso, o Brasil realiza a cada dois anos uma avaliação nacional censitária - a Prova Brasil - e usa a pontuação média para calcular e monitorar sistematicamente seu Índice de Qualidade da Educação Básica (IDEB).


    A coexistência de avaliações nacionais e internacionais e de diferentes métricas para acompanhar o desempenho de um mesmo sistema educacional suscita as três questões abordadas neste blog: (1) Como os resultados de aprendizagem se comparam entre avaliações? (2) Como as avaliações nacionais e internacionais podem ser alinhadas? (3) Qual a importância da escolha do indicador de resultados de aprendizagem?


    1.    Comparando avaliações de aprendizagem: contrastando fotografias nacionais e internacionaisComparar duas avaliações de aprendizagem é um desafio, mesmo que elas pretendam medir o mesmo conteúdo e a mesma população estudantil. Na psicometria, este desafio é conhecido como linking. É como comparar duas fotos da mesma floresta, tiradas com dias de intervalo, usando diferentes lentes, velocidade, luz e sensibilidade de filme. O tempo da foto reflete os alunos sendo avaliados em diferentes séries ou momentos do ano letivo. A amostragem em cada avaliação, semelhante à sensibilidade do filme, pode dar uma imagem mais ou menos precisa da aprendizagem e limitar nossa capacidade de ampliar a imagem. Finalmente, cada avaliação tem sua própria escala para medir a proficiência; assim como uma lente grande angular captura um amplo escopo, uma lente teleobjetiva permite ao fotógrafo registrar  uma área reduzida em detalhes. Todos estes fatores combinados podem criar composições contrastantes ao
    destacar aspectos distintos de um mesmo assunto.


    Vamos usar esta analogia fotográfica para comparar os resultados do aprendizado em português e matemática no Brasil utilizando como base avaliações nacionais e internacionais. Para tanto, é preciso definir as premissas utilizadas na análise fotográfica. Primeiramente, para minimizar a diferença no momento das fotos, selecionamos a combinação mais próxima de anos e séries: no final do ensino primário, comparamos o resultado da Prova Brasil – reportado na escala SAEB – dos alunos do quinto ano com o resultado da LLECE dos alunos do sexto ano, ambos em 2013. No final do ensino fundamental, analisamos os resultados do PISA aplicado a estudantes de 15 anos e os contrastamos com a avaliação Prova Brasil aplicada aos alunos do nono ano, ambos em 2015. Vale notar que as  resoluções (ou sensibilidade da película fotográfica) adotadas diferem significativamente: LLECE e PISA são baseados em amostras e avaliam alguns milhares de alunos cada, enquanto a Prova Brasil testa cerca de 2 milhões de alunos
    em cada série. Finalmente, para avaliar o alcance dos limites mínimos de proficiência nas diferentes avaliações, utilizamos o parâmetro definido pelo GAML no caso do LLECE e PISA ao passo que para a Prova Brasil usamos as pontuações mínimas (na escala SAEB) propostas porespecialistas convocados pela ONG Todos pela Educação em 2006.


    Como se comparam essas fotos da aprendizagem no Brasil? A figura 1 ilustra nossas conclusões. Cada barra representa a proporção de alunos por nível. As barras de cor laranja representam a proporção dos alunos abaixo da proficiência mínima, enquanto as barras em azul representam a proporção daqueles acima do nível mínimo de proficiência ; cada tonalidade corresponde a um nível de proficiência definido por pontos de corte nas respectivas escalas. Observamos que a proporção de alunos abaixo do nível mínimo de proficiência na avaliação nacional é consistentemente maior do que a proporção encontrada em avaliações internacionais. A princípio, tal discrepância poderia ser explicada  por três fatores: (i) os alunos são testados em séries anteriores no exame nacional; (ii) o nível de aspiração nacional pode ser mais ambicioso que o internacional; ou, (iii) as escalas não são estritamente comparáveis.


    Figura 1 - Proporção de alunos em cada nível de proficiência, por disciplina nas avaliações nacionais e internacionais


    Nota: para obter detalhes sobre os níveis de proficiência de cada avaliação disponível, consulteLLECE,SAEB,PISA2.    Alinhando escalas de avaliações nacionais e internacionaisUma questão central inerente ao exercício de comparação entre diferentes avaliações de aprendizagem, sejam elas nacionais ou internacionais, se refere à comparabilidade das escalas usadas para gerar indicadores. Neste contexto, uma das maiores contribuições da GAML foi mudar o foco da discussão sobre métricas dos indicadores, abandonando a ambição de uma escala comum - o que exigiria que todos os países aplicassem a mesma avaliação de forma a gerar resultados comparáveis - e introduzindo umaMatriz Global de Proficiência. Essa Matriz descreve ascompetênciasque os estudantes devem dominar para serem considerados proficientes em cada etapa. O seu uso possibilita comparar avaliações em diferentes países, sem exigir o uso de uma escala única. Embora menos precisa, esta abordagem possui a vantagem de utilizar sistemas
    de avaliação de aprendizagem já existentes e pode aumentar a compreensão e a apropriação dos resultados da avaliação pelos países, facilitando o alcance do ODS4. Com base nessa Matriz, os especialistas do GAML mapearam os níveis de proficiência de várias avaliações de aprendizagem internacionais ( por exemplo, PISA e PIRLS) e regionais (por exemplo, LLECE, SAQMEC, e PASEC) em um continuum e identificaram os níveis mínimos de proficiência a serem atingidos em três momentos do ciclo educacional: inicio do primário (entre 1.o e 3.o ano), final do primário (de 4.o a 6.o ano), e início do secundário (de 7.p a 9.o ano).


    Para implementar esse mapeamento entre os níveis de proficiência de avaliações nacionais e os níveis de proficiência mínimos usados pelo ODS4 e definidos pela referida Matriz, é fundamental ir além de uma triangulação empírica, como feita neste blog (Figura 1). Aúltima conferência do GAML, realizada em outubro de 2020, discutiu algumas técnicas para realizar esse exercício de mapeamento. São elas:


    1.    Incluiritens globaisnas avaliações nacionais de aprendizagem que poderão ser usados para ‘linkar’  psicometricamente as duas escalas de proficiência a serem comparadas (ao nível nacional e a definida no âmbito da Matriz Global de Proficiência);2.    Adotar aabordagem da Pedra Rosetta da UIS/IEA, segundo a qual duas avaliações de aprendizagem com diferentes escalas – uma nacional e outra internacional - são aplicadas a um mesmo grupo de estudantes gerando um fator de conversão que pode ser utilizado para traduzir resultados dos indicadores. Esta abordagem vem sendo testada peloLaboratorio da UNESCO/UIS/IEAna Colômbia e Guatemala para ‘linkar’ a escala do LLECE com a escala do PIRLS; ou3.    Realizar“linkagem” por moderação social, onde especialistas da avaliação nacional juntamente com especialistas internacionais mapeiam as pontuações mínimas que demonstram o domínio da competência avaliada nas diferentes escalas (atualização da “linkagem” apresentada na 7ª reunião do GAML).


    3. Escolhendo o indicador de resultados de aprendizagemO Brasil possui um sólido sistema de monitoramento educacional: a Prova Brasil permite avaliar a aprendizagem dos alunos, enquanto o Censo Escolar por aluno permite acompanhar as trajetórias de escolarização individualizadas.


    Além desses instrumentos de coleta de dados, o país adotou o IDEB como uma forma simples de comunicar o seu monitoramento educacional, tanto em termos de escolarização quanto de aprendizado. Ele é um indicador multidimensional, composto pelo produto de dois termos: (i) a média das notas dos testes de português e matemática no final de cada ciclo educacional; e (ii) a média harmônica da taxa de aprovação de todos os anos do respectivo ciclo educacional. O IDEB é amplamente divulgado pela mídia nacional e constitui a principal métrica de referência do desempenho de sistemas de educação municipais e estaduais no Brasil.


    Apesar do uso disseminado e metodologia robusta, o IDEB possui alguns ‘pontos cegos’. O primeiro deles se refere ao uso da pontuação média do teste, o que pode mascarar importantes aspectos referentes a distribuição da medida de aprendizagem na população de alunos. Como ilustra a Figura 2, a nota média e a proporção de alunos abaixo do nível mínimo de proficiência não se movem na mesma velocidade. Enquanto a proporção de alunos que não conseguem ler proficientemente no final do primário caiu quase pela metade (de 72% para 39%) entre 2007 e 2019, a média das notas aumentou apenas 22% no mesmo período. [Você pode interagir com a figura para visualizar outros anos, disciplinas e etapas]. Isso acontece porque as mudanças na proporção de alunos proficientes é impactada por mudanças tanto na pontuação média quanto na distribuição da pontuação na população de alunos (vejaoutro blogque discute este ponto usando dados do PISA). Neste sentido, é importante destacar que sistemas educacionais que
    queiram ter uma métrica sensível às desigualdades de aprendizagem não devem se basear em notas médias. O foco nos estudantes com pior desempenho é o primeiro passo para um maior compromisso com a equidade educacional.


    Figura 2 - Evolução da pontuação média e proporção de alunos abaixo da proficiência mínima


    O segundo ‘ponto cego’ refere-se a possibilidade de inflar os resultados de avaliações de aprendizagem do IDEB através da redução da taxa de participação dos estudantes (i.e. a proporção entre os alunos que fazem a prova e o número total de alunos matriculados) com menor desempenho esperado. Apesar de mitigar este problema nos seus resultados por escola, uma vez que o IDEB só é reportado para escolas com uma taxa de participação acima de 80%, o mesmo não ocorre com o IDEB por município e estado, onde as notas dos alunos de escolas com baixa participação são incluídas na média final.


    Olhando para frente, é possível identificar algumas oportunidades para melhorar o IDEB. A primeira delas seria incluir a taxa de participação dos alunos na Prova Brasil como um componente na fórmula de cálculo do IDEB. Este componente poderia operar como um fator de ajuste da nota final, valorizando os esforços de estados e municípios que buscam ampliar a taxa de participação dos seus alunos no exame nacional. A segunda possibilidade de melhoria seria utilizar a proporção de alunos abaixo de um patamar mínimo de proficiência como medida de aprendizado. Como visto acima, este indicador alternativo é sensível a mudanças na distribuição da notas dos alunos. A terceira melhoria potencial seria ajustar o indicador pela proporção dos alunos fora da escola ou com grandes defasagens idade-série de forma a aumentar a sensibilidade do IDEB à equidade de acesso à educação


    A mensuração da aprendizagem é parte fundamental de uma política educacional baseada em evidências. Neste contexto, as escolhas de medidas importam. E muito.

  content: 'Even before COVID-19 forced a massive closure of schools around the globe, the world was in the middle of a learning crisis that threatened efforts to build human capital—the skills and know-how needed for the jobs of the future. More than half (53 percent) of 10-year-old children in low- and middle-income countries either had failed to learn to read with comprehension or were out of school entirely. This is what we at the World Bank calllearning poverty. Recent improvements in Learning Poverty have been extremely slow. If trends of the last 15 years were to be extrapolated, it will take 50 years to halve learning poverty. Last year we proposed a target to cut Learning Poverty by at least half by 2030. This would require doubling or trebling the recent rate of improvement in learning, something difficult but achievable.  But now COVID-19 is likely to deepen learning gaps and make this dramatically more difficult.


    Temporary school closures in more than180 countries have, at the peak of the pandemic, kept nearly 1.6 billion students out of school; for about half of those students, school closures are exceeding 7 months. Although most countries have made heroic efforts to put remote and remedial learning strategies in place, learning losses are likely to happen. A recent survey of education officials on government responses to COVID-19 by UNICEF, UNESCO, and the World Bank shows that while countries and regions have responded in various ways, only half of the initiatives are monitoring usage of remote learning (Figure 1, top panel).  Moreover, where usage is being monitored, the remote learning is being used by less than half of the student population (Figure 1, bottom panel), and most of those cases are online platforms in high- and middle-income countries.


    Source: Authors'' calculation using the UNESCO-UNICEF-WB Survey on National Education Responses to COVID-19 School Closures (n=116)http://uis.unesco.org/en/news/survey-national-education-responses-covid-19-school-closures-due-12-june-2020


    COVID-19-related school closures are forcing countries even further off track from achieving their learning goals. Students currently in school stand tolose $10 trillion in labor earningsover their working lives. That is almost one-tenth of current global GDP, or half the United States’ annual economic output, or twice the global annual public expenditure on primary and secondary education.


    In arecent briefI summarize the findings ofthree simulation scenariosto gauge potential impacts of the crisis on learning poverty. In the most pessimistic scenario, COVID-related school closures could increase the learning poverty rate in the low- and middle-income countries by10 percentage points, from 53% to 63%. This 10-percentage-point increase in learning poverty implies that an additional 72 million primary-school-age children could fall into learning poverty, out of a population of 720 million children of primary-school age.


    Figure 2 Learning Poverty could increase by 10 percentage points in Low-and Middle-income countries, in the most pessimistic scenario


    out of 100 children in Low- and Middle-income countries


    Source:Azevedo (2020). Pessimistic Scenario (of 70% of school closure, very low mitigation effectiveness, no remediation, and WB-MPO June). For more details on the simulation methodology, seeAzevedo et al (2020)


    This result is driven by three main channels:  school closures, effectiveness of mitigation and remediation, and the economic impact. School closures, and the effectiveness of mitigation and remediation, will affect the magnitude of the learning loss, while the economic impact will affect dropout rates. In these simulations, school closures are assumed to last for 70% of the school year, there will be no remediation, mitigation effectiveness will vary from 5%, 7% and 15% for low-, middle- or high-income countries, respectively. The economic channel builds onmacro-economic growth projections, and estimates the possible impacts of economic contractions on household income, and the likelihood that these will affect primary school age-school-enrollment.


    Most of the potential increase in learning poverty would take place in regions with a high but still average level of learning poverty in the global context pre-COVID, such as South Asia (which had a 63% pre-pandemic rate of learning poverty),Latin America (48%), and East Asia and the Pacific (21%). In Sub-Saharan Africa and Low-income countries, where learning poverty was already at 87% and 90% before COVID, increases would be relatively small, at 4 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively. This reflects that most of the learning losses in those regions would impact students who were already failing to achieve the minimum reading proficiency level by the end of primary—that is, those who were already learning-poor.


    To gauge at the impacts of the current crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and Northern Africa we need to examine other indicators of learning deprivation. In these two regions children are on average the furthest below the minimum proficiency level, with a Learning Deprivation Gap (the average distance of a learning deprived child to the minimum reading proficiency level) of approximately 20%. This rate is double the global average (10.5%), four times larger than the East Asia and Pacific Gap (5%), and more than tenfold larger the Europe and Central Asia average gap (1.3%). The magnitude of learning deprivation gap suggests that on average, students on those regions are one full academic year behind in terms of learning, or two times behind the global average.


    In the most pessimistic scenario, COVID-19 school closures might increase the learning deprivation gap by approximately 2.5 percentage points in Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. However, the same increase in the learning deprivation gapdoes notimply the same impact in qualitative terms. An indicator of the severity of learning deprivation, which captures the inequality among the learning deprived children, reveals that the severity of learning deprivation in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa could increase by approximately 1.5 percentage points, versus an increase of 0.5 percentage points in Latin America. This suggests that the new learning-deprived in Latin America would remain closer to the minimum proficiency level than children in Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. As a consequence, the range of options required to identify students’ needs and provide learning opportunities, will be qualitatively different in these two groups of countries—
    more intense in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East than in Latin America.


    In absolute terms, Sub-Sharan Africa and the Middle East and Northern Africa would remain the two regions with the largest number of learning-deprived children. The depth of learning deprivation in Sub-Saharan Africa will increase by three times more than the number of children who are learning-deprived. This is almost three times the global average, and four times more than in Europe and Central Asia. This suggests an increase in the complexity and the cost of tackling the learning crisis in the continent.


    Going forward, asschools reopen, educational systems will need to be more flexible and adapt to the student’s needs. Countries will need to reimagine their educational systems and to use the opportunity presented by the pandemic and its triple shock—to health, the economy, and the educational system—tobuild back better. Several policy options deployed during the crisis, such as remote learning solutions, structured lesson plans, curriculum prioritization, and accelerated teaching programs (to name a few), can contribute to building an educational system that is more resilient to crisis, flexible in meeting student needs, and equitable in protecting the most vulnerable.


    The results from these simulations are not destiny. Parents, teachers, students, governments, and development partners can work together to deploy effective mitigation and remediation strategies to protect the COVID-19 generation’s future. School reopening, when safe, is critical, but it is not enough. The simulation results showmajor differences in the potential impacts of the crisis on the learning poor across regions. The big challenge will be to rapidly identify and respond to each individual student’s learning needs flexibly and to build back educational systems more resilient to shocks, using technology effectively to enable learning both at school and at home.'
  summary: Even before COVID-19 forced a massive closure of schools around the globe, the world was in the middle of a learning crisis that threatened efforts to build human capital—the skills and know-how needed for the jobs of the future.

  content: '在之前一文中，我们强调了从起码熟练程度角度对人人学习效果进行监测的重要性。在可持续发展目标中，各国一致同意开展学习效果监测，监测重点为处于学习效果分布图底部的学生。我们分析了熟练程度在不同时期的变化，结果表明这一指标对学习效果分布图的变化敏感，学习效果差异增大始终伴随着教育结果变差。


    每当你思考教育结果差异，你脑海中会浮现什么？大多数人会立刻描绘出按性别、社会经济状况、种族或民族划分的差异。列举的这些差异属横向差异，即按社会和文化背景划分的不同组别之间的差异。遗憾的是，横向差异现象目前仍很普遍。在阿富汗9-21岁年龄组别中，从未上过学的女童多达男童的两倍。在巴西， 顶层收入五等分组中的青年完成中等教育的概率比底层五等分组中的青年高出了55个百分点。在美国，亚裔学生从大学毕业的概率是黑人学生的近两倍。


    各组别内部也存在差异，即纵向差异。这两种差异的区分——组别间差异（横向差异）和组别内差异（纵向差异）——对政策设计很有用，因为处理每种差异所需的工具和方式方法大为不同。关于（学习机会）可及性方面的文章已有很多；在本文中，我们集中关注学习效果差异。


    下列互动式汇总图表中包含109个国家2000年以来16轮国际学习效果评估的数据，其中包括对600多万名学生的观测数据。你可以任选其中一国、一轮评估、一个学科以及一个细目（按性别、城乡或社会经济状况五等分位划分），查看各组别间学生分数分布的差异。除这些分布图之外，一份表格还给出了针对这些组别的摘要统计结果：用于监测可持续发展目标4.1.1的中间分数、分数的标准偏差以及熟练程度（或我们的互动式数据可视化图中选取的未达某种熟练程度的学生占比）。


    让我们把注意力集中在未达起码熟练程度学生的占比上。评估差异的常规做法是报告组别间差异，但有必要分析整个系统的表现，而不仅仅分析非系统内的不平等现象：一个表现欠佳教育系统内的平等机会并不足以实现人人学习目标。例如：


    - 最新一轮国际学生评估项目（PISA）的评估结果显示，从社会经济状况（SES）角度看，塞尔加尔和加拿大学生表现出相同的差异：顶层 SES五等分组别学生达到起码阅读熟练程度的概率比底层组别学生高出了15个百分点。但总体熟练程度差异巨大：塞内加尔未达起码熟练程度的学生占91%，而加拿大的这一占比仅为14%。


    - 最新一轮PISA评估结果显示，秘鲁学生在阅读方面的社会经济状况差异最大，为57个百分点。尽管组别间差异巨大，但总体熟练程度并不低。实际上， 秘鲁富裕家庭学生的学习成绩优于卢森堡一般家庭的学生。


    组别间差异（按性别、城乡以及SES五等分位划分）仅仅是全貌的一小部分。这些差异合计占一国国内考试分数总体差异的13%（其中，SES五等分组别间差异在三类差异中最为显著）。在未过多探究细节情况下，我们通过计算广义熵阶的差异指数得出了这一数字。此类差异度量指标的特别之处在于它们具有子组别一致性和加成可分解性。也就是说，它们有助于拆分出组别间和组别内差异的具体数值。


    你可能注意到了一点，即上述分组并不能给出学校资源差异和地区差异。鉴于此，我们就把参与评估的每所学校视为一组。据此，34%的差异为各校间差异，66%的差异为跨校差异。


    即便我们组合采用这两种方式，把各子组别与各种可能的学校、城乡、学生性别以及SES五等分组的组合放在一起考虑，我们也会发现，只有50%的差异为跨子组别差异。当然，确切数值会随国别学科评估和年份的不同而有所浮动。但是，总体结论在不同时期和各轮次评估中都很稳定（你可以在我们的数据可视化图中查找结论）：50%的差异为同一所学校性别和社会经济状况五等分组别相同的学生之间的差异。


    学习效果差异为何事关重大，我们该怎样做才弥合差异？


    上述发现既令人清醒也令人鼓舞。我们要清醒地认识到，了解应对教育不均等问题以实现各组别学生学习效果均等化的过程中所采取的常用方式只能有助我们完成该目标的一半。不过，发现学习效果在类似学生之间存在如此大的差异也令人鼓舞——这一发现意味着，通过把同一组别内所有学生的学习效果提高到该组内表现最佳学生的水平，我们就能够在弥合差异方面取得很大进展。


    在国际学习效果评估过程中分解出学习效果差异的实践表明了对横向和纵向差异或组别间和组别内差异进行监测的重要性。我们所讲的组别内差异是度量不可归因于学生可观察特征（即其性别、社会经济状况以及所在学校）的差异的一个指标。目前仍不可观察的特征很复杂：教育学家和心理学家已开发出相关度量指标，用于找出并阐释各类学生之间存在的学习效果差异，但以具有可比性的方式推广应用这些指标目前仍是一个难题。


    今后，有必要思考并明确我们应当度量什么及如何度量：


    - 选取对差异情况变化敏感的度量指标：以上结果显示，组别内差异（即垂直差异）显著，这在最贫困学生中体现得尤为突出。因此，有必要用差异敏感性指标对度量学习效果的标准化指予以补充。了解关于重点度量未达起码熟练程度学生且具有分布敏感性的指标的讨论，请参见在可持续发展目标技术合作小组最近一次会议上介绍的论文。


    - 采用差异化施教方式专门应对垂直差异：能够调动学生参与且契合学生学业水平的课堂教学方式，如因材施教方式或结构性授课计划，可优先适用于需掌握基础技能的所有学生。这些方式被列入了 “最划算、最有效”的教育方式之列。了解关于哪些因素使得这些方式取得成功的更深入讨论，请查看关于明确学习目标设定、施教一致性、教师支持以及语境凸显性的ALIGNS（使施教水平契合学习目标和学生需求的教学水平）原则。


    - 找出可从中汲取宝贵经验的单元（国家、地区或学校）：对横向和纵向差异进行监测是一种极其有效的策略，有助于有针对性提出政策建议并识别正向偏差因素。大环境很重要：差异程度较低的一国为提升本国学习效果采取的某项干预措施，在差异程度较高的另一国未必同样有效。在国内或区内，找出垂直差异程度最低的学校可为制定促进所有儿童学习的有效新策略提供启示。


    要应对教育差异问题，就要开展严密评估，也要采用对差异情况变化敏感的度量指标。努力实现各组别学生学习均等化很有必要，但还不够。我们也必须推广相关方案和干预措施，以应对来自同一所学校和同一个人群的类似学生之间存在的差异。在这方面，我们拥有很多工具，但需要面向我们的孩子使用这些工具。'

  content: 'On a previous blog, we highlighted the importance ofmonitoring learning for all through the lens of a minimum proficiency level, which focuses on those students at the bottom of the learning distribution – as countries have agreed in the Sustainable Development Goals. We examined how proficiency has changed over time, showing that this measure is sensitive to changes in the learning distribution and that increases in learning inequality have always been accompanied by the worsening of educational outcomes.


    What comes to mind when you think about inequality in educational outcomes? Most people immediately picture disparities by sex, socio-economic status, or race and ethnicity. These are examples of horizontal inequality: inequality between different socially and culturally formed groups. Unfortunately, horizontal inequality remains widespread. InAfghanistan, twice as many girls as boys aged 9-12 have never been to school. InBrazil, youth from the top income quintile are 55 percentage points more likely to complete secondary education than youth in the bottom quintile. And in theUnited States, Asian students are almost twice as likely to graduate from college than Black students.


    There is also inequality within groups, known as vertical inequality. Differentiating between these two types of inequalities – between groups (horizontal inequality) and within groups (vertical inequality) – is valuable for policy design, since the tools and approaches required to deal with each are quite different. Much has been written regarding inequalities in access; in this blog, we focus our attention on learning inequalities.


    Inequality between groups


    The interactive dashboard below contains data from 109 countries over 16 rounds of international learning assessments since 2000, with observations for over 6 million students. Choose a country, assessment, subject, and breakdown – by sex, urban/rural, or socio-economic status (SES) quintile – to see how the distributions of student scores across groups differ. Besides the distribution plots, a table reports the main summary statistics of these groups: the mean, the standard deviation of scores (SD), and the proficiency level used to monitor the SDG 4.1.1 (or any share of students below a proficiency threshold chosen in our interactive dataviz).


    Let’s focus on the share of studentsbelow minimum proficiency. It is customary to measure inequality by reporting the gap between groups. But it is essential to look at the overall system performance, not just its inequality: equal opportunity in a poor-performing educational system does not suffice to deliver learning for all. For example:


    - SenegalandCanadahad the same SES gap in the latest PISA-D/PISA results: students from the top SES quintile were 15 percentage points more likely to achieve minimum reading proficiency than students in the bottom quintile. But the overall levels were dramatically different: in Senegal, 91% of students were below the minimum proficiency, while in Canada, only 14% were.


    - Peruhad the largest SES gap in reading in the last PISA round, at 57 percentage points. Despite the high inequality across groups, levels are not low. In fact, the affluent Peruvian achieve learning outcomes superior to the average student inLuxembourg.


    Figure 1- Distribution of test scores by groups within a country


    Inequality within groups


    These differences across groups – sex, urban/rural, and SES quintiles – are only a small part of the story. Jointly, they account for 13% of the overall inequality of scores within a country (with inequality across SES quintiles being the single most relevant of the three). Without getting too much into the weeds, we arrive at this number by calculating inequality indices of theGeneralized Entropyclass. What is special about this class of inequality measures is that they are subgroup consistent and additively decomposable. That is, they allow to parcel out the amount of inequality between and across groups.


    You may notice that the groups mentioned above fail to capture differences in school resources and regional disparities. So let’s consider each school participating in the assessment as a group. Now 34% of the inequality is between schools and 66% within schools.


    Even when we combine the two approaches, by considering subgroups with all possible combinations of schools, urban/rural, students’ sex, and SES quintiles, we find that only half of the inequality happens across these subgroups. Of course, the exact amount fluctuates by country subject assessment and year. But the overarching conclusion is stable over time and across assessments (and you can explore it in our data visualization): half of the inequality is between students in the same schools with the same sex and socio-economic status quintile.


    Figure 2- Between- and within-group inequality decompositions


    Why does it matter, and what can we do about it?


    These findings are both sobering and encouraging. Realizing that the usual pathways in the quest to tackle education inequality – equalizing learning across groups – can only take us half-way towards this goal is sobering. But it is encouraging to find so much variation in learning for similar students: it means a lot of progress can be made by bringing all students in a group to the level of its top performers.


    This exercise of decomposing inequality in international learning assessments shows the importance of monitoring both horizontal and vertical learning inequality, or inequalities between and within groups. Our within-group inequality is a measure of what cannot be attributed to students’ observable characteristics, such as their sex, socio-economic status, and the school they attend. What remains unobservable is complex: educators and psychologists have developed measures to capture and explain learning differences across students, but scaling up these measures in a comparable way across countries remains a challenge.


    Going forward, it is essential to be deliberate and intentional on what we measure and how we measure:


    - Chose measures that are sensitive to changes in inequality: The results above highlight that inequality within groups (vertical inequality) is significant, especially among the most deprived students. Thus, it is crucial to complement the standard measures of learning performance with inequality-sensitive indicators. For a discussion on measures that focus on the students below the minimum proficiency and are distributional-sensitive, please seethis paperpresented at the latestSDG Technical Cooperation Group meeting.


    - Use differentiated instruction to target vertical inequality: Classroom instruction that is engaging and aligned to children’s learning levels, such as Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) or structured lesson plans, prioritizes all children mastering foundational skills. These approaches were highlighted as some ofthe smart buysin education, and for a deeper discussions on the aspects that have made these approaches successful check theALIGNS principlesaround setting clear learning goals, instructional coherence, teacher support and contextual salience.


    - Identify units from which valuable lessons can be extracted: Monitoring horizontal and vertical inequality can be a powerful strategy to customize policy recommendations and to identify positive deviants. Context matters: an intervention that improves learning in a country with low inequality may not be equally effective in a country with high inequality. And within a country or district, identifying the schools with the lowest vertical inequalities can shed light on effective new strategies to get all children learning.


    Tackling inequality in education calls for careful measurement and the use of measures sensitive to inequality changes. Efforts to equalize learning across groups are essential but not sufficient. We must also scale programs and interventions that tackle inequality of similar students within schools and demographic groups. We have the tools for this, and we owe it to our children.'
  summary: Efforts to equalize learning across groups are essential but not sufficient. We must also scale programs and interventions that tackle inequality of similar students within schools and demographic groups. We have the tools for this, and we owe it to our children.

  content: 'Before COVID-19, the world was already in a learning crisis. At historical rates of progress, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of ensuring that all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education, leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030, is out of reach.More than half of children in low- and middle-income countries are either out-of-school or fail to learn to read with comprehension by age ten. At the secondary level, the situation is even direr.


    Learning losses due to the pandemic will likely be large. We are only starting to grasp how learning inequalities  may play out. Looking at historical data, can we find patterns that can help us better plan our actions in the near future? As countries build back educational systems that are more resilient, equitable, and inclusive – capable of delivering learning for all – how likely is that learning inequality might undermine this process?


    Education SDGs: beyond average scores


    Let us consider lower-secondary students'' learning outcomes, as assessed by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA provides comparable data of 15-year-old pupils'' performance in mathematics, science, and reading. Much attention is spent discussing country ranks and improvements of the average PISA test scores. But the average gives an incomplete picture in an unequal world. And we know that multiple sources of inequality generate variations in learning at school and at home across gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and disabilities.


    Through the SDG process, countries have agreed to monitor learning for all through the share of students achieving a minimum proficiency level. For instance, in reading, lower secondary students should recognize the main idea in a text, understand relationships, or construe meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and make low level inferences. Failing to master these basic competencies will preclude them from participating effectively and productively in life as continuing students, workers and citizens.  To go beyond the test score of the average student reflects a strong commitment to focus our attention on improving learning for the kids that fail to reach these minimum standards of skills/competences.


    These two performance measures of education systems – average scores and the share of students achieving minimum proficiency convey important information. They are akin to observing the changes in average income per capita and in the share of the population living in poverty, when assessing a country''s growth and welfare performance over time. The average income per capita and the average test score are summary measures of all individuals. The share of the population living in poverty and the share of students below the minimum proficiency level refer to the percentage of students failing to acquire a minimum set of competences and are deprived of minimum standards of living and of acquired competences, respectively. In education, just like in the economy, those measures do not necessarily move in the same direction.


    Unbundling progress in the share of students achieving minimum proficiency


    Economists have long investigated the relationship between poverty, growth, and inequality, and understand that those are jointly determined. Changes in poverty rates can be unpacked into the contributions of changes in the mean (average income per capita) and income distribution (inequality). A similar decomposition can be insightful in the education context. An improvement in the average test score with growing inequality will be qualitatively different from a process in which the average test score increases by the same amount, but inequality remains constant.


    We explore data from countries that participated in multiple PISA rounds. Each bar in Figure 1 represents the decomposition of the annualized change in students'' share below the SDG threshold in reading between two rounds of PISA for a given country. The countries in red performed worse in recent years. That is, the share of students who cannot read proficiently increased by at least 0.1 percentage at an annualized rate. The countries in green have seen improvement: more students achieving minimum proficiency in reading. Lastly, for the countries in yellow, the proficiency share remains reasonably similar. We decompose the change in the share of students below minimum proficiency (black line) into the contribution from the average score (dark bars) and the distribution of scores (light bars).


    Figure 1- Decomposition of changes in the share of students below minimum proficiency (BMP)


    The reader can use our interactive visualization to extend this analysis to mathematics and science and subgroups of students by gender, location, and quintile of socioeconomic status. We also include any two years of PISA participation – not just the longest interval of time in which the subject was the major focus of assessment. An alternative decomposition methodology is also used, but more of that in another blog. Results remain qualitatively similar – as you can see by interacting with the filters in Figure 1. Another way to visualize these results is by averaging all countries that improved or worsened. This is done in Figure 2, which summarizes the decomposition for reading in over 300 observations (each corresponding to a country and pair of years of participation).


    Figure 2 Absolute and relative  contributions to  changes in the share of students below minimum proficiency (BMP)


    Some stylized facts emerge:


    ➤ A rising tide [almost always] lifts all boats


    - All countries which improved their proficiency level also have increased average test scores. In Peru, the share of students who cannot read the basics fell from 80% to 54%, or an annualized rate of change of approximately -1.4p.p. per year.  During this period, average scores rose from 327 to 401 points between 2000 and 2018, while inequality in learning worsened - meaning if the inequality in test scores would have remained the same as in 2000, the improvement on the share of students below the MPL would have been 3p.p. higher, or the equivalent of two additional years of average improvement.


    - Only in a few countries, the share of students achieving proficiency worsened despite small improvements in average test scores.  In Georgia, the mean score rose by 6 points between 2009 and 2018; nevertheless, the students'' share below the minimum proficiency threshold increased by 2.4 percentage points. So it was students with higher test scores that improved the most.


    ➤ When average test scores fall, the inequality in learning always got worse; and there was no clear pattern when proficiency level improved


    - In all countries where the share of students below minimum proficiency increased, the inequality in learning worsens the situation. In South Korea, the average scores in 2018 were almost the same as in 2000, but the share of youth who cannot read at minimum proficiency increased from 6% to 15% as inequality in learning increased.


    - The proficiency level can improve even when inequality in learning worsens. Between 2006 and 2018, the share of students below minimum proficiency in Colombia increased by almost 6 percentage points, although average test scores surged 27 points, reflecting larger improvements in learning for children with relatively higher learning achievement.


    Visualizing country examples can clarify the decomposition. Figure 3 shows overlaid distributions of reading scores in a country for two PISA rounds - the first in blue and the latest in red. In countries like Peru, the two snapshots in time have similar shapes but different average test scores, given the impression that the curve slid, the rising tide that lifted all boats. In South Korea, the mean remained the same, but the distribution''s shape (inequality in learning) changed significantly between the years.


    Figure 3- Distribution of reading scores in two rounds of PISA for selected countries


    Design policies for scale with a focus on learning for all


    The SDGs gave us a consensus on minimum proficiency levels of learning. We must build on that to document and understand the drivers of change. Learning for all requires overcoming inequalities across and within countries.


    Across countries, we must be obsessed with achieving results at scale.Small-scale successful interventions that benefit a small group of children will not suffice to address the magnitude of the learning crisis. Interventions and policies need to be designed for scale. This does not neccesarily mean that we need to overhaul the entire education system in the short term to achieve improvements in learning. More focused policies at scale, as described in the“Ending Learning Poverty Report”andexemplified by the state of Ceará in Brazil, can generate significant short-term improvements, while at the same time countries take on the more difficult longer term task of building robust education systems.


    In order to ensure that learning occurs for all, we must measure and track changes in learning for kids failing to reach minimum proficiency levels.Assessing the performance of educational systems based on average scores or achievement gaps between groups is not enough. We should be intentional and systematic on how we document and understand the learning inequality within systems. Not all educational systems propagate inequalities in the same way.


    We expect COVID-19 to negatively affect the learning distribution, as it has happened before in all episodes of decline in learning proficiency. Periods of reduction of learning proficiency have never been distributionally neutral. Going forward, we must mitigate and remediate the learning losses of the most vulnerable. We have the opportunity and responsibility to reimagine and build back educational systems that are more resilient and able to better protect the learning from the most vulnerable, especially at moments of crisis.'
  summary: Learning losses due to the pandemic will likely be large. We are only starting to grasp how learning inequalities may play out. Looking at historical data, can we find patterns that can help us better plan our actions in the near future?

  content: 'Antes da COVID-19, o mundo já estava em uma crise de aprendizado. Com taxas históricas de progresso, a meta dos Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS) de garantir que todas as meninas e meninos concluam a educação primária e secundária gratuita, equitativa e de qualidade, levando a resultados de aprendizagem relevantes e eficazes até 2030, está fora de alcance.Mais da metade das crianças em países de renda baixa e média estão fora da escola ou não conseguem ler com compreensão aos dez anos de idade. No nível secundário, a situação é ainda pior.


    As perdas de aprendizado devido à pandemia provavelmente serão grandes. Estamos apenas começando a entender qual será o impacto da desigualdade de aprendizagem. Olhando para os dados históricos, podemos encontrar padrões que nos ajudem a planejar melhor nossas ações no futuro próximo? À medida que os países reconstroem sistemas educacionais que são mais resilientes, equitativos e inclusivos - capazes de promover a aprendizagem para todos - qual a chance da desigualdade de aprendizagem atrapalhar esse processo?


    ODS de educação: além da pontuação média


    Vamos considerar os resultados de aprendizagem de alunos nos anos finais do ensino fundamental, conforme avaliados pelo Programa de Avaliação Internacional de Alunos (PISA). O PISA fornece dados comparáveis sobre o desempenho de alunos de 15 anos em matemática, ciências e leitura. Muita atenção é dedicada à discussão das classificações dos países e das melhorias nas pontuações médias nos testes do PISA. Mas a média fornece uma imagem incompleta em um mundo desigual. Sabemos que múltiplas fontes de desigualdade causam variações na aprendizagem na escola e em casa por gênero, etnia, status socioeconômico e deficiências.


    Por meio do processo dos ODS, os países concordaram em monitorar a aprendizagem de todos através da parcela de alunos que alcançam um nível mínimo de proficiência. Por exemplo, em leitura, os alunos dos anos finais do ensino fundamental devem reconhecer a ideia principal de um texto, entender as relações ou interpretar o significado usando uma parte limitada do texto na qual a informação não é proeminente e fazer inferências básicas. A falta de domínio dessas competências básicas os impedirá de participar efetiva e produtivamente da vida futura como estudantes, trabalhadores e cidadãos. Ir além da pontuação do aluno médio reflete um forte compromisso em focar nossa atenção na melhoria da aprendizagem das crianças que não conseguem atingir esses padrões mínimos de habilidades / competências.


    Essas duas medidas de desempenho dos sistemas educacionais - pontuação média e proporção de alunos que alcançam proficiência mínima transmitem informações importantes. São semelhantes a observar as mudanças na renda média per capita e na parcela da população que vive na pobreza, ao avaliar o desempenho econômico de um país ao longo do tempo. A renda média per capita e a pontuação média do teste são medidas sintéticas de todos os indivíduos. A percentagem da população em situação de pobreza e a percentagem de alunos abaixo do nível mínimo de proficiência referem-se à percentagem privada de padrões mínimos de vida e de competências adquiridas, respetivamente. Na educação, assim como na economia, essas medidas não caminham necessariamente na mesma direção.


    Desagregando o progresso na proporção de alunos que alcançam proficiência mínima


    Os economistas há muito investigam a relação entre pobreza, crescimento e desigualdade e entendem que eles são determinados em conjunto. As mudanças nas taxas de pobreza podem ser decompostas nas contribuições das mudanças na média (renda média per capita) e na distribuição de renda (desigualdade). Uma decomposição semelhante pode ser esclarecedora no contexto educacional. Uma melhoria na pontuação média do teste com crescente desigualdade será qualitativamente diferente de um processo no qual a pontuação média do teste aumenta na mesma proporção, mas a desigualdade permanece constante.


    Exploramos dados de países que participaram de várias rodadas do PISA. Cada barra na Figura 1 representa a decomposição da mudança anualizada na participação dos alunos abaixo do limite do ODS na leitura entre duas rodadas do PISA para um determinado país. Os países em vermelho tiveram pior desempenho nos últimos anos. Ou seja, a proporção de alunos que não conseguem ler com proficiência aumentou em pelo menos 0,1 por cento a uma taxa anual. Os países em verde viram melhorias: mais alunos alcançando proficiência mínima em leitura. Por último, para os países em amarelo, a parcela de proficiência permanece razoavelmente semelhante. Decompomos a mudança na proporção de alunos abaixo da proficiência mínima (linha preta) na contribuição da pontuação média (barras escuras) e na distribuição das pontuações (barras claras).

    O leitor pode usar nossa visualização interativa para estender esta análise para matemática e ciências e subgrupos de alunos por gênero, localização e quintil de status socioeconômico. Também incluímos quaisquer dois anos de participação no PISA - não apenas o intervalo de tempo mais longo em que a disciplina foi o foco principal da avaliação. Uma metodologia de decomposição alternativa também é usada, mas abordaremos isso em um outro blog. Os resultados permanecem qualitativamente semelhantes - como você pode ver ao interagir com os filtros na Figura 1. Outra maneira de visualizar esses resultados é calculando a média de todos os países que melhoraram ou pioraram.

    Alguns fatos estilizados emergem:


    ➤ A maré alta [quase sempre] levanta todos os barcos


    - Todos os países que melhoraram seu nível de proficiência também aumentaram as pontuações médias em testes. No Peru, a proporção de alunos que não sabem ler o básico caiu de 80% para 54%, ou uma taxa de variação anualizada de aproximadamente -1,4p.p. por ano. Durante este período, as pontuações médias aumentaram de 327 para 401 pontos entre 2000 e 2018, enquanto a desigualdade na aprendizagem piorou - ou seja, se a desigualdade nas pontuações dos testes tivesse permanecido a mesma de 2000, a melhoria na proporção de alunos abaixo do nivel de proficiencia mínimo acordado pelos através dos Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável seria 3p.p. superior, ou o equivalente a dois anos adicionais de melhoria média.


    - Apenas em alguns países, a proporção de alunos que alcançaram a proficiência piorou, apesar de pequenas melhorias nas pontuações médias nos testes. Na Geórgia, a pontuação média aumentou 6 pontos entre 2009 e 2018; no entanto, a proporção de alunos abaixo do limite mínimo de proficiência aumentou 2,4 pontos percentuais. Portanto, foram os alunos com notas mais altas nos testes que melhoraram mais.


    ➤ Quando as pontuações médias nos testes caem, a desigualdade na aprendizagem sempre piora; e não houve um padrão claro quando o nível de proficiência melhorou


    - Em todos os países onde a proporção de alunos abaixo da proficiência mínima aumentou, a desigualdade na aprendizagem piorou a situação. Na Coréia do Sul, as pontuações médias em 2018 foram quase as mesmas de 2000, mas a proporção de jovens que não conseguem ler com proficiência mínima aumentou de 6% para 15% à medida que a desigualdade no aprendizado aumentou.


    - A proficiência pode melhorar mesmo quando a desigualdade na aprendizagem piora. Entre 2006 e 2018, a proporção de alunos abaixo da proficiência mínima na Colômbia aumentou quase 6 pontos percentuais, embora as pontuações médias nos testes tenham aumentado 27 pontos, refletindo maiores melhorias na aprendizagem de crianças com desempenho de aprendizagem relativamente mais alto.


    A visualização de exemplos de países pode esclarecer a decomposição. A Figura 3 mostra as distribuições sobrepostas das pontuações de leitura em um país para duas rodadas do PISA - a primeira em azul e a última em vermelho. Em países como o Peru, as duas fotos no tempo têm formas semelhantes, mas pontuações médias diferentes nos testes dão a impressão de que a curva deslizou, a maré alta que levantou todos os barcos. Na Coreia do Sul, a média permaneceu a mesma, mas a forma da distribuição (desigualdade no aprendizado) mudou significativamente entre os anos.


    Figura 3- Distribuição das pontuações de leitura em duas rodadas do PISA para os países selecionados


    Projetar políticas para escala com foco no aprendizado para todos


    Os ODS nos deram um consenso sobre os níveis mínimos de proficiência de aprendizagem. Devemos construir sobre isso para documentar e compreender os motores da mudança. Aprendizado para todos requer a superação das desigualdades entre os países e dentro deles.


    Em todos os países, devemos estar obcecados em obter resultados em escala. Intervenções bem-sucedidas em pequena escala que beneficiam um pequeno grupo de crianças não serão suficientes para lidar com a magnitude da crise de aprendizagem. As políticas e intervenções precisam ser planejadas em escala. Isso não significa necessariamente que precisamos revisar todo o sistema educacional no curto prazo para alcançar melhorias no aprendizado. Políticas mais focadas em escala, conforme descrito no “Relatório Ending Learning Poverty” eEstado do Cearáno Brasil, podem gerar melhorias significativas de curto prazo, enquanto, ao mesmo tempo, os países assumem a tarefa mais difícil de construir a longo prazo sistemas de educação robustos.


    Para garantir que o aprendizado aconteça para todos, devemos medir e monitora as mudanças no aprendizado das crianças que não alcançam os níveis mínimos de proficiência. Avaliar o desempenho dos sistemas educacionais com base em pontuações médias ou lacunas de desempenho entre os grupos não é suficiente. Devemos ser intencionais e sistemáticos na maneira como documentamos e entendemos a desigualdade de aprendizagem dentro dos sistemas. Nem todos os sistemas educacionais propagam as desigualdades da mesma maneira.


    Estimamos que a COVID-19 afetará negativamente a distribuição da aprendizagem, como já aconteceu antes em todos os episódios de declínio de aprendizagem. Períodos de redução da proficiência de aprendizagem nunca foram neutros do ponto de vista de distribuição. Daqui para frente, devemos mitigar e remediar as perdas de aprendizagem dos mais vulneráveis. Temos a oportunidade e a responsabilidade de reimaginar e reconstruir sistemas educacionais mais resilientes e capazes de proteger melhor a aprendizagem dos mais vulneráveis, especialmente em momentos de crise.'
  summary: Antes da COVID-19, o mundo já estava em uma crise de aprendizado.

    COVID-related school closures are forcing countries even further off-track to achieving their learning goals.  The students currently in school stand to lose $10 trillion in labor earnings over their work life. To get a sense of the magnitude, this sum is one tenth of global GDP, or half of the annual economic output of the United States, or twice the global annual public expenditure on primary and secondary education.


    Temporary closures in more than180 countries have kept nearly 1.6 billion students out of school, further complicating global efforts to reduceLearning Poverty. While most countries have made heroic efforts at putting in place remote and remedial learning strategies, learning losses are accumulating rapidly. A recent survey fromUNICEF-UNESCO-World Bank on national education responses to COVID-19 school closuresshows that while the response across countries and regions varies, it has been difficult to reach even half of all students (see Figure 1). Despite vigorous initiatives in Bangladesh, for example, take-up of remote learning isonly in the single digits.


    There are studies to measure learning losses directly, such asmethodological workon phone-based assessments inBotswanaandPakistan. But the global community will need to wait many months—if not years—for a complete picture of global learning losses. In the meantime, many important decisions about funding, school re-openings and teaching strategies have to be made. To inform these decisions, we have developedsimulationsof the effects of school closures lasting 3 (optimistic), 5 (intermediate), or 7 months (pessimistic) with varying degrees of effectiveness of mitigation measures. Our results add to information from previous simulation exercises such asRiseandRTI.


    Figure 1  Remote learning strategies vary across country income groups and educational levels


    How do we get to $10 trillion?


    In our intermediate scenario, schools are closed for five months. These are the estimates that we find most likely, given that most school systems closed in March and, though with exceptions, we see many countries planning to reopen after the summer. In this scenario, we expect to see a global loss of 0.6 learning-adjusted years of schooling (LAYS), making the global average fall from 7.9 LAYS to 7.3 LAYS. Being out of school for that long means that children not only stop learning, they also tend to forget a lot of what they have learned.


    We use the PISA global database to estimate how learning levels could be affected. The closures could result in an average of 16 points of lost learning in terms of PISA scores for lower secondary students. They could increase the share of students not acquiring minimum proficiency from 40 to 50 percent (Figure 2). An estimated 7 million students are likely to drop out of school. The effects on girls and vulnerable and marginalized groups will likely be much worse.


    Figure 2: The share of children below minimum proficiency is likely to increase by 25 percent


    To gauge the long-term economic impacts of these learning losses, we projected how they could affect future earnings. In our intermediate scenario, a typical student’s future earnings will fall by $872 a year, reaching a total loss of $16,000 in lifetime earnings in present value terms. Using global data on household labor incomes, we allow these results to vary by country. We then add up the country-level results for all learners who are enrolled in primary and secondary education in the world. Combined, this generation of studentsstands to lose an estimated $10 trillionin earnings over its work life.


    How do our figures compare with other estimates? For student who are expected to work, we estimate an income loss of 5 percent of lifetime earnings. In the United Kingdom, economists predict an earnings loss of3% of yearly income. In the United States, one study forecasts a loss of2-2.5% of income, another up to13% of the US current GDP. Our estimates for the world as a whole are comparable in severity, despite slightly different methodological approaches.


    The relative impacts of these losses on low income countries (LICs) are higher when measured in terms of their public investment in basic education. LICs could lose more than three full years of their investment in basic education; high income countries stand to lose less than two years of their investment. This underscores the especially urgent need to protect investments in education in the poorest countries. We know that human capital investments power long run economic development. Governments and development partners need to immediately step up efforts to protect and increase investments in people.


    How to recover and accelerate learning


    As outlined in ourrecent education policy response, governments would do better if they plan their actions in three phases: coping, managing continuity and improving and accelerating. In deciding and preparing for reopening of schools, they should consult with their communities, teachers, parents, and students to understand and address their concerns. They should assess the safety of operations, developing clear protocols for hygiene and social distancing as described inFramework for Reopening Schools. In many settings, basic infrastructure for handwashing and hygiene will need to be put in place. They should also increase investments and teacher training in remote learning and accelerated learning recovery.


    While actions have to be tailored to each context, a common focus ought to be strengthening the capacity of schools to reduce risks of disease transmission and promote healthy behavior. Health and safety concerns may require managing the number of on-site students through double shifts, targeting early grades and vulnerable groups, and combining in-person instruction with remote learning. There should also be a focus on recovering lost learning by assessing learning loss, supporting socioemotional well-being, and targeted remedial measures. Also needed are loud re-enrolment campaigns and cash transfers to make sure that school systems do not lose children permanently. Governments and school leaders also need to pay special attention to protecting vulnerable groups. Given the high risksof increased disparities, marginalized students must be a high priority in COVID-19 education response strategies. Students below and near minimum learning proficiency deserve special attention.


    As challenging as COVID-19 is for education, it can be transformed into a watershed event for building more equitable and resilient education systems. Recovery from COVID-19 offers the opportunity to reimagine educational systems—using technology to improve outcomes, addressing inequality, and reducing learning poverty. It has long been clear that education and schools need to change to prepare children for the future and ensure that all children are learning. The investments being made now in remote learning—in multimedia content, remote training and support of teachers, and remote learning assessments—can be a launchpad for more personalized ways of providing education.


    Reimagined education systems must eventually be able to individualize instruction. They should be able to provide compensatory learning to rapidly recover the learning lost to school closures or student dropout. They will need to work hard to integrate learning in the classroom and remote learning, enabling children to learn well both in school and at home. If they do all this, policy makers will not only be prepared to smooth interruptions in learning during this and future pandemics but also build today the education systems of the future.


    For more on the simulations and their assumptions and results, seeSimulating the Potential Impacts of the COVID-19 School Closures on Schooling and Learning Outcomes: A set of Global Estimates. See theFramework for Reopening Schoolsfor guidelines that aim to inform the decision-making process regarding school reopening, support national preparations, and guide the implementation process as part of overall public health and education planning processes.'
  summary: COVID-related school closures are forcing countries even further off-track to achieving their learning goals. The students currently in school stand to lose $10 trillion in labor earnings over their work life.

  content: 'Необходимой стратегией сокращения распространения нового коронавируса (COVID-19) было социальное дистанцирование, что заставило большинство стран закрыть свои школы. Однако с учетом того, что 1,5 млрд детей в 175 странах мира не посещают школу (по состоянию на 10 апреля), вопрос о долгосрочных последствиях данной стратегии для системы образования вызывает все большую озабоченность. Мир уже столкнулся с кризисом в области обучения, и продолжающаяся чрезвычайная ситуация создаст дополнительную нагрузку на с трудом достигнутые результаты в области обучения. В нашей текущей работе по моделированию этих последствий мы предлагаем подумать о последствиях закрытия школ для «кривой обучаемости». Это поможет нам сосредоточить внимание на самых бедных и самых неблагополучных учащихся и разработать более эффективные стратегии смягчения последствий в интересах детей.


    Кривые обучаемости обычно составляют те, кто проводит национальные оценки (например, национальные оценки прогресса в области образования –NAEP) или международные оценки (например, Программа международной оценки успеваемости учащихся –PISA, Международное исследование тенденций в области математики и естественных наук –TIMSS, или Прогресс в проведении международного исследования по вопросам грамотности в области чтения –PIRLS). Средние баллы (представленные в верхней части) этих кривых, вероятно, наиболее известны, поскольку дляопределения рейтинга странзачастую используют средние баллы. Но из этих кривых мы можем извлечь гораздо больше информации. Ширина кривой (т.е. стандартное отклонение), например, является одним из индикаторов неравенства в школьных системах. Другая очень важная особенность этих кривых заключается в том, что их можно использовать для определения рейтинга учащихся в зависимости от уровня их знаний.


    За последние несколько лет много усилий было затрачено на то, чтобы сделать кривые обучаемости более сопоставимыми в отношении нижнего ранга исполнителей, или детей, достигающих лишьминимального уровня мастерства. (Учащиеся, достигшие минимального уровня мастерства, отображаются в виде серой зоны слева от красной пунктирной линии). В прошлом году Всемирный банк взял на себя обязательство уделять особое внимание «малообразованным учащимся» - учащимся ниже минимального уровня знаний, которые не могут читать и понимать основной текст к 10 годам. Мы обеспокоены этой группой, потому что дети, которые не научились читать достаточно быстро, не могут преуспеть позже в школе или при поступлении на работу.


    Диаграмма 1 - Три возможных варианта развития кривой обучаемости в ближайшие месяцы: более низкое среднее значение, более высокое стандартное отклонение или резкий рост низких показателей обучения в нижней части.


    В своей текущей работе мы рассматриваем три возможных варианта кривой обучаемости, которые могут существенно повлиять на уровни обучения в странах, где школы закрыты. Каждый вариант обусловлен различным механизмом, который в настоящее время оказывает влияние на учащихся. Первый из них является самым простым преобразованием, которое вызвано снижением средних уровней обучения по всему распределению (синяя кривая). Это весьма вероятный сценарий, несмотря на все усилия, предпринимаемые школьными системами для обеспечения дистанционного обучения.Изменение учебного временисвязано с потерями в обучении. Предыдущие кризисы, такие какрецессия2008-09 гг., оказали существенное негативное воздействие на процесс обучения, особенно в районах с более высокой долей неблагополучных детей и детей из числа меньшинств. Имеются также свидетельства того, что такие потрясения, какнаводнения, существенно влияют на результаты обучения в различных классах. Дети, которые не посещают школу, учатся меньше, несмотря
    на наилучшие намерения дистанционного образования и тех, кто учится на дому.


    Второй вариант. Рассмотрим, как кривая может сплющиваться (или наклоняться) из-за крайне неравномерных последствий кризиса (фиолетовая кривая). Это вариант, при котором дети, находящиеся сверху, будут двигаться вперед, в то время как ученики снизу будут отставать все больше. Даже если вирусу все равно, богаты вы или бедны, богатые имеют гораздо больше возможностей смягчить его последствия. Более состоятельные семьи находятся в комфортабельных домах, имеют хорошее подключение к Интернету, могут нанять частного репетитора, и, возможно, лучше всего подходят для домашнего обучения хорошо образованным родителям. Бедные семьи, особенно крайне бедные, живут в низкокачественных домах, могут не иметь даже радио, не говоря уже об Интернете или цифровых гаджетах, не иметь ресурсов, чтобы нанять репетитора, и будут с трудом справляться с домашними заданиями своих детей. В нижней части распределения доходов может также наблюдаться резкийрост бедностииз-за отсутствия возможности работать или безработицы.
    В этом варианте богатые вырвутся вперед, а бедные еще больше отстанут.


    Третий вариант. Рассмотрим, как кривая может измениться из-за отсева (зеленый цвет - население, которое сейчас постоянно не посещает школу). Из более ранних кризисов, таких какфинансовый кризис в Азии в 1997-98 гг.ипандемия полиомиелита в 1916 г., мы узнали, что посещаемость школ может резко упасть как из-за побочных факторов спроса, так и из-за побочных факторов предложения. Что касается спроса, то резкое падение доходов вынуждает семьи просить своих детей выходить на работу, и они больше никогда не возвращаются в школу. Мы особенно обеспокоены положением девочек, поскольку они, как правило, первыми прекращают посещать школу. Мы можем столкнуться с увеличением числа закрываемых школ. Правительства будут испытывать нехватку наличных средств, поскольку глобальная экономическая система испытывает трудности. Это может привести к тому, что министерства образования будут вынуждены увольнять учителей и закрывать или объединять школы. Кроме того, многие страны расширили охват школьным образованием
    через частные школы с низкой платой за обучение. Эти школы, как правило, работают на крошечной марже, и мы не знаем,переживут ли они этот кризис.


    Для того чтобы понять, насколько значительными окажутся последствия кризиса COVID-19, потребуется время. Но мы не можем ждать так долго, нужно начинать действовать уже сейчас, поэтому мы моделируем воздействие данного кризиса на процесс обучения. Опираясь на имеющиеся данные о воздействии кризисов, а также на наши базы данных, такие, как«Согласованные результаты обучения»и«Набор данных об обучении в условиях нищеты», мы смоделируем процесс развития кривой в случае, если мы не предпримем соответствующих действий. Мы рассмотрим различные варианты развития событий, подобные представленным выше, и то, каким образом различные стратегии по уменьшению последствий могут помочь в этом.


    У нас есть все возможности повлиять на кривую обучаемости.


    Это будет «живой» документ. По мере того, как будут появляться результаты и новые прогнозы, мы будем обновлять этот блог и пытаться оценить, как разворачивается эта чрезвычайная ситуация. А пока, просим поделиться с нами своими мыслями и проектами, или дать нам знать, есть ли что-то конкретное, что вы хотели бы, чтобы мы оценили.'

  content: 'Social distancing has been a necessary strategy to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), leading most countries to close their school systems. But with 1.5 billion children out of school in 175 countries (as of April 10), there are more and more concerns about the longer-term effects on learning. The world was already in a learning crisis, and the ongoing emergency will put further strain on hard-won gains in learning. In our ongoing work simulating these effects, we propose to think about the effects that school closures will have on the “learning curve.” Doing this will help us focus on the poorest and worst-off students, and to design better mitigation strategies that are in the best interest of children.


    Learning curves are typically drawn by the makers of national assessments (such as National Assessment of Educational Progress -NAEP) or international ones (such as Programme for International Student Assessment -PISA, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study -TIMSS, or Progress in International Reading Literacy Study -PIRLS). The average scores (represented by the top) of these curves are probably most famous, because averages are often used torank countries. But there is a lot more that we can learn from these curves. The width of the curve (i.e., the standard deviation), for instance, is one of the indicators of inequality within school systems. Another very important feature of these curves is that they can be used to rank students based on proficiency levels.


    Over the last few years, a lot of effort has gone into making learning curves more comparable with regards to the bottom rank of performers, or kids reaching onlyminimum proficiency. (Students falling below minimum proficiency are displayed as the grey area to the left of the red dashed line). Last year, the World Bank committed to focus on the “learning poor” – the students below the minimum proficiency level who cannot read and understand a basic text by age 10. We are concerned about this group, because children who do not learn to read early enough often fail to thrive later in school or when they join the workforce.


    Figure 1 – Three possible scenarios of how the learning curve may evolve in the coming months: a lower average, a higher standard deviation, or a sharp increase in low learning at the bottom.


    In our ongoing work, we are looking at three possible scenarios for the learning curve, which may substantially affect the levels of learning in countries with school closures. Each scenario is caused by a different mechanism that is affecting students right now. The first is the most straightforward transformation, which is caused by a reduction in average learning levels across the distribution (the blue curve). This is an extremely likely scenario despite the best efforts of school systems to offer distance learning.Variation in instructional timeis associated with learning loss. Previous crises such as the 2008-09recessionhad a substantial negative effect on learning, particularly in districts with higher proportions of disadvantaged and minority children. There is also evidence that shocks likefloodssubstantially affect learning outcomes across grade levels. Children who are not in school learn less, despite the best intentions of distance education and home schoolers.


    Secondly, consider how the curve may flatten (or skew) due to highly unequal effects of the crisis (the purple curve). This is a scenario in which children who are at the top will pull ahead, while students at the bottom fall further behind. Even if the virus does not care whether you are rich or poor, the rich are much better placed to mitigate its effects. Wealthier families are in comfortable homes, have good internet connections, can hire a private tutor, and may be better placed for home schooling by well-educated parents. Poor families, especially the extreme poor, live in inferior homes, may not have even a radio let alone internet connection or digital gadgets, don’t have the resources to hire a tutor, and will struggle to keep up with their children’s homework. The bottom of the income distribution may also see a sharpincrease in povertyfrom lack of opportunities to work, or from unemployment. In this scenario, the wealthy will pull ahead, and the poor will fall further behind.


    Thirdly, consider how the curve may change due to dropouts (the green population that is now permanently out of school). We have learned from earlier crises, such as the1997-98 Asian financial crisisand the1916 polio pandemic, that school enrolment can fall sharply, due to both demand and supply side effects. On the demand side, the income shock leads families to ask their children to work, and they never go back to school. We are particularly concerned about girls, given that they are usually the first to be withdrawn from school. On the supply side, we might see increased numbers of school closures. Governments will be cash strapped, as the global economic system is taking a hit. This may lead ministries of education to furlough teachers and to close or merge schools. Also, many countries have expanded schooling through low-fee private schools. These schools are typically operated on tiny margins, and we don’t know if they willsurvive this crisis.


    It will take time to know how large the effects of the COVID-19 crisis will be. But we cannot wait that long to act, and thus we are simulating the impact on learning now. Building on existing evidence of the effect of crises of learning, and our databases such as theHarmonized Learning Outcomesand theLearning Poverty dataset, we will model how the curve will evolve if we do not take appropriate action. We will look at different scenarios like the ones depicted above, and how different mitigation strategies might help.


    We are not powerless to influence the learning curve.


    This will be a living document. As results and new forecasts become available, we will update this blog, and try to assess how this emergency is unfolding. In the meantime, please supply us with your thoughts and projects, or let us know if there is something specific you would like us to estimate.'
  summary: Social distancing is a necessary strategy to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). With 1.5 billion children out of school in 175 countries (as of April 10), there are more and more concerns about the longer-term effects that school closures will have on them.

    Many people think of poverty as the consequence of a series of overlapping conditions and circumstances, where deprivations take many forms and stack up to raise a tower of difficulty. They may think about not having enough money to make ends meet, but beyond this poverty could also mean having limited access to education and health services, job prospects, water and sanitation infrastructure, and beyond. A shift in thinking about what poverty measurement actually means in these terms is not new (see OPHI and UNDP,as well as our own work), but taking a multidimensional approach is a welcome addition to the poverty analyst’s toolkit. It has proven to be particularly useful in understanding poverty in Croatia, a high-income European Union country.


    Croatia gives municipalities and towns the responsibility of providing key public services. There are 556 municipalities in the country, some with fewer than 300 people and many lacking the capacity to effectively fulfill these responsibilities. The country’s absorption of EU funds has also faced numerous challenges with implications for regional convergence within the country: There is a strong overlap between central and local governments, which limits the implementation of public policies, increases costs, and undermines effective use of resources.


    In 2015, the World Bank worked with Croatia’s Central Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds, and Ministry of Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy to provide more evidence on the geographic distribution of poverty. But the exercise did not stop there. The Government of Croatia wanted to use the evidence base to inform the design of policies and the allocation of their budget along with EU funds to promote inclusion and regional development, particularly in deprived areas.


    This led to the creation of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which gives policy makers a mechanism to align line ministries toward a common goal. The poverty maps for Croatia (Figure 1 – Poverty map) provided the foundation for the IMD, a tool meant to simultaneously address existing vulnerabilities of the population and challenges in effectively reaching those in need. It is of great use for policy making since it assists in identifying, monitoring, and diagnosing lagging regions.


    The government of Croatia has already made use of the poverty maps and the IMD to inform a proposal to adjust the country’s regional subdivision. The proposed split would separate Zagreb, the capital, from Slavonia which is in the eastern part of the country. The revision would imply that EU funds could be better targeted to what the evidence at hand points as the poorest area of the country. Additionally, the IMD and the poverty maps have assisted the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds in selecting eight cities with very distinct deprivation profiles to benefit from EU-funded revitalization programs.


    The index uses information on poverty at the municipal level to inform which indicators of deprivation should be included and how they contribute (provided as a dashboard). Indicators are mapped to sub-domains, and sub-domains are mapped to domains of deprivation (Figure 2 – diagram of IMD indicators). Each indicator, sub-domain, and domain weigh the same (within each level). For example, road density (within the physical infrastructure sub-domain) has an equal weight as all the other indicators within that sub-domain, and the physical infrastructure subdomain carries the same weight as the social services sub-domain under the Access to Services domain. However, social services is composed of three indicators, while physical infrastructure has five. Consequently, any indicator in the social services sub-domain carries a greater weight towards the total IMD, but the Access to Services domain has the same weight as the Economic and Social domains.


    The list of indicators comes from the digital social welfare register (Soc-Skrb) database at the municipal level. The IMD is an aggregate index for different dimensions which is comparable across time where a higher value indicates a higher deprivation (Figure 3 - IMD 2015). Comparability is achieved since values for any indicator today are anchored to the specific indicator’s distribution from 2011 (to overcome issues of dimensionality and temporal comparison). For example, a municipality’s current unemployment rate is compared to the municipal distribution of unemployment in 2011, and if the current value is larger than the median of 2011 it will count as a deprivation.


    So, let’s put the tool to the test: assume that the government of Croatia is looking to invest in an education project in Slavonia, one of the poorest regions in the country. In determining which town or municipality in the region it should prioritize, the IMD provides an initial filter (Figure 4 – Dashboard for Slavonia). The figure provides a picture of the poorest and most deprived in Slavonia. Our initial cut-off could be all those towns with a deprivation index above the median, which are excluded. This first filter can be easily checked by other actors engaged in the process, providing transparency. Among the selected localities (Figure 5), it is now straightforward to determine who is in most need of attention. Priority should be given to Otok, Kutjevo, and Pleternica.


    In this case, the IMD has provided a simple, transparent, and replicable process to determine who should be given attention in a specific area. The tool is useful for policy makers who want to understand which localities and in what areas they are lagging, or to compare locations. The IMD is a step in the right direction, it adds evidence towards policy and enhances transparency.

  content: 'In April,PovcalNetrevised the World Bank’s global and regional poverty estimates from 1981 to 2013. The next major update of global and regional poverty estimates is scheduled for October 2018, when the global poverty estimates for the reference year 2015 will be released. This will coincide with the launch of the next Poverty and Shared Prosperity report (the 2016 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report can be foundhere).


    The April 2018 update includes 97 new surveys, which brings the total number of surveys to 1577. With Malta now included for the first time, the total country coverage of the global poverty monitoring stands at 164 countries. Aside from the addition of new surveys, several changes to the existing data have been made. Some changes reflect improvements in the welfare aggregate based on new harmonization efforts and more available information. For example, an update to the harmonization methodology of theSocio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean(SEDLAC), has created revisions to many poverty estimates in this region. Other changes involve improvements and minor corrections in the construction of welfare aggregates. When relevant, auxiliary data, such as the CPIs and National Accounts data, have also been updated as part of the regular updating cycle. Finally, a few surveys have been dropped from the database based on data quality concerns, such as concerns over insufficient
    documentation and a lack of inter-temporal comparability. A detailed description of all changes made are outlined inAtamanov et al. (2018).Source:PovcalNetNotes: Detailed description inAtamanov et al. (2018).Table 1 details the impact of the updates on global poverty in 2013. The global $1.90 headcount ratio increases from 10.7% to 10.9% with the new data, and the number of poor increases from 769 million to 783 million people. This changeat the global levelis primarily driven by new surveys from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Particularly, new surveys in Bangladesh and Ethiopia each add more than 7 million poor people compared to the previous estimate, which was based on extrapolations of older surveys.Some regions have also undergone substantial changes for theregionalheadcount ratios that are less noticeable at the global level. In the Middle East and North Africa, the headcount ratio increases from 2.3% to 2.7%, and the number of poor from 8.3 million to 9.6 million. This is
    driven by revised growth rates for Syria in recent years. In Europe and Central Asia, the headcount ratio decreases from 2.2% to 1.6% and the number of poor from 10.4 million to 7.7 million. This is primarily driven by changes for Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where poverty has been revised downward. In Tajikistan, this is caused by replacing with surveys of greater comparability, and in Uzbekistan by a new CPI series. These revisions are described in more detail inAtamanov et al. (2018).The revised data can be accessed athttp://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet.'

  content: 'Online pundits, hurried journalists and policymakers love precision. They crave numbers. Preferably exact numbers; ranges suggest uncertainty and make them anxious. As a result, they will love theWorld Poverty Clock(WPC), a new website that claims to track progress towards ending global poverty in real time (see also thisblogandFinancial Times article). The website tells you that 632,470,507 people are currently living in extreme poverty - or were, on December 6 at 10:00am… Even more amazingly, the site claims to forecast poverty at any point in the future until 2030, the deadline for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. By scrolling along the elegant timeline on the bottom of the WPC screen you will learn, for example, that in 2028, 459,309,506 people will be living in extreme poverty!


    If you pause for a moment to consider the myriad sources of uncertainty about what may happen to our world in the next ten years, this must strike you as a remarkably precise forecast. And it is presented down to the decimal point, with no indication of possible error, or of the margin of confidence viewers should place on it. Because, as its ‘methodology’ tab reluctantly admits, the WPC is based primarily on poverty data from the World Bank’sPovcalNet, with which we are involved, we felt it was probably incumbent on us to clarify a few points.First, although the team behind the WPC does include one World Bank staff member, the WPC estimates were not produced or vetted by the World Bank teams responsible for monitoring global poverty. In fact, we were never consulted about the data or methods. That said, we are always happy when the poverty data we curate and assemble is used by others to focus public attention on the plight of the extreme poor – those living on $1.90 per day or less
    – and on the challenge the world community faces in meeting SDG 1.1. Of course, long before the WPC came along, a number of studies had already highlighted that reaching the 3% goal by 2030 is far from guaranteed (e.g.Ravallion,Edward & Sumner).Clever uses of global poverty data for advocacy and public debate are a great thing. That is exactly why the founders of PovcalNet made it a public tool, to begin with. But, to be useful, advocacy must be honest and, in forecasting, honesty requires at least a discussion of the sources of uncertainty associated with one’s predictions. As Tony Atkinson reminded us in his report of the Commission on Global Poverty, even our global estimates of past poverty are subject to numerous sources of error (World Bank, 2017, p. 49). These include the usual sampling errors in the underlying household surveys, but also inaccuracies in population statistics, errors in the ‘lining up’ procedure, errors embodied in Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates and in
    national consumer price indices, and so on. In other words, even in the latest year for which we have actual data, our estimate of global poverty is imprecise. For this reason, we tend to report the number of poor with one or two decimals on the million (e.g.World Bank, 2016, p. 4).Even that is probably too much precision, and we plan to be even more explicit about uncertainty in the future. We havecommitted, given the necessary resources, to follow the recommendation of the Atkinson Commission to estimate the statistical confidence band around our poverty numbers, arising from the sum of all those different sources of error, and to report it alongside our point estimates. Because most of that error is unlikely to come from sampling, which statistics can handle more easily, that is easier said than done. It requires a level of in-house statistical capacity that we still need to invest in. (For starters, even an accurate estimate of sampling error requires information on complex survey
    design, which countries seldom make available to us.)  But to be perfectly clear, the direction of travel is towards more - not less - transparency about the inevitable uncertainty surrounding our poverty estimates – even about the past!Now, when one goes beyond the past, and seeks to project into the future, estimates naturally become even less precise. This is because, in addition to measurement error (both sampling and non-sampling), forecasts require modeling (however simple), and thus involve modeling error. Models may be incorrectly specified in two broad sorts of ways: first, they might include the right variables but get their functional forms and coefficients wrong. Second, and more worryingly, models may altogether fail to allow for the possibility of crises, epidemics and other unforeseen events that may turn out to matter a great deal. Try, for example, to look for macroeconomic projections for 2008/2009 in, say, the US, that were published one or two years before the onset
    of the last global financial crisis, in December 2007… Or for growth and poverty forecasts for Sierra Leone published before the onset of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa...Poverty projections, specifically, require forecasts for at least three key ingredients: National population, mean income and its distribution. Demographic trends can be predicted relatively precisely, but growth forecasts are often (or should we say, almost always) wrong. See, for example, Figure 2 inthis blogcomparing IMF global GDP growth forecasts against actual growth. Furthermore, it is typically assumed that mean incomes grow at whatever rate is forecast for national GDP, although it is well known that growth rates in GDP and surveys can – and often do – diverge.As for changes in distribution, poverty projections typically assume that national inequality remains unchanged. As there exist no standard projections of inequality (because it is extremely difficult to model and forecast), such a simplification
    is understandable. But it is unlikely to be correct. At the very least, one ought to check for the sensitivity of the poverty forecast to alternative paths for national inequality, asLakner, Negre and Prydzdo in atoolthat simulates poverty headcounts after users specify a growth rate and its degree of pro-poorness. A key difference between this online tool and the WPC is that the World Bank site makes it explicit that one is looking at different scenarios, given certain distribution and growth assumptions made by the user. Although there are (still) no confidence intervals around each individual scenario, the range of outcomes arising from differences across scenarios is itself a powerful indication of the uncertainty inherent in poverty projections.Fighting poverty is important work. Those planning future action to combat it deserve to be told what we can and cannot confidently predict. The fact that there are some precision addicts out there is no excuse for feeding their craving.
    We would like to be able to welcome the World Poverty Clock as a useful tool for advocacy and debate. But that will require a great deal more circumspection about the uncertainty associated with its forecasts. And, while its makers are at it, they can probably be a little more open about their data sources, assumptions, and methods too.'

  content: 'Access to finance is an important tool against poverty since it allows for the smoothing of consumption. The equality of access amongst different groups in the society is also crucial in terms of correctly allocating the positive benefits of improved financial services.


    In arecent paperpublished in the World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series we proposed and computed anEquity Adjusted Coverage rate (EACR) for a range of financial inclusion indicators inTurkey. This work complements the conventional coverage or use of financial services by adjusting for theequityof its coverage, on the basis of a set of `circumstances’. The characteristics or circumstances that are accounted for, in Turkey’s case, are gender, age, education, income quintile, and urban/rural.


    The FINDEX database shows that 57.6 percent of individuals (aged 15+) in Turkey had a bank account (coverage rate) in 2011 (Figure below). However, when adjusted for the inequality of the access among the above mentioned characteristics, this coverage rate is penalized, and drops down to 44.0 percent. In 2014, Turkey’s coverage rate decreased slightly but the EACR actually improved to 48.3, mostly driven by an improvement of gender equality between 2011 and 2014.


    Unlike Brazil, Turkey’s dissimilarity in account ownership is driven by gender. A Shapley decomposition measures the contribution of each circumstance onto the dissimilarity index. In 2011, the coverage in Turkey was 57.6 and 55.9 in Brazil. However, the level of dissimilarity, and what accounts for the dissimilarity is very different between the two countries. Turkey’s dissimilarity is 8 percentage points higher than Brazil at 23.7, resulting in a lower overall EACR for bank account ownership in Turkey. Moreover, 58.4 percent of the dissimilarity is due to gender in Turkey, compared to only 8.8 percent in Brazil. In Brazil, the main sources of inequality are age and income.


    Between 2011 and 2014, Turkey was able to substantially decrease the contribution of gender in its dissimilarity of bank account usage.Contribution of gender on the d-index fell from 58.4 to 39.4 over the three years. The overall decrease in the level of dissimilarity was mainly driven by this improvement in the gender component as the absolute contribution of gender on dissimilarity fell from 13.8 in 2011 to 5.7 in 2014. However, gender continues to be the largest source of dissimilarity suggesting that the continuation of this positive trend in gender equity is crucial in further increasing the EACR of Turkey in terms of bank account ownership.


    Overall savings and savings in financial institutions


    Turkey is among the countries with the lowest savings rates, both at the individual and the household level. In the FINDEX database, Turkey ranks the fifth lowest in the world among 145 countries, with 9.6 percent of individuals reporting that they save in 2011. In terms of individuals saving at a formal financial institution, Turkey is also near the bottom of the global distribution at 9.1 percent in 2014.  Moreover, the amount of savings differs amongst income groups in Turkey. Individuals in the highest income quintile are almost three times more likely to save than the members of the lowest quintile. This disparity amongst the bottom and top quintile groups is parallel with varying account usage levels across Turkey.


    Turkey’s performance in financial inclusion demonstrates that the country has been successful in spreading the use of financial tools at a broad level. However, there are continuing challenges in terms of the equitable distribution of financial access and awareness in using a robust combination of financial instruments. By promoting more savings, and ensuring that all parts of the society have access to formal institutions, Turkey can boost the financial security of its citizens. In this respect, the recent progress from a gender equality perspective can be seen as encouraging progress that must be built on going in to the future.'

The equality of access amongst different groups in the society is also crucial in terms of correctly allocating the positive benefits of improved financial services.

  content: 'Poverty is often measured using repeated cross-sectional surveys that provide a snapshot of the poverty status of a given household at a particular point in time. Such designs call for interviewing different respondents in each round, and because individuals or households are only observed once, we cannot always tell whether their poverty status is enduring or transitory.


    This begs the question: how often do households enter and exit poverty in the short-run?As discussed in ourprevious post, there can be large fluctuations in the prevalence of poverty by season. Given the aggregate changes we see within the year at the national level, it is very important to understand to which extent such fluctuations are also affecting different individuals and households in different ways within the year. Indeed,research by Martin Biewenat IZA finds that, in mostly developed economies, household transitions into and out of poverty can be substantial.Panel survey designs that repeatedly visit the same respondents enable such detailed monitoring of trends within the year. In the case of Tajikistan’s Household Budget Survey, the same households are interviewed in each quarter, allowing us to see whether households remain poor over long periods, or whether there is “churning” into and out of poverty from one quarter to the next.Note: Author’s calculation using the TJK
    HBSAs the graph above shows, in Tajikistan, about 50% of households are never poor in a given 4-quarter period, and about 10% are consistently poor. The remaining 40% of households are at times poor, while at other times they are above the poverty line for the quarter. These estimates imply that there is room to improve the targeting of poverty-related initiatives by taking these fluctuations into account.This churning has clear data collection quality implications, and illustrates the additional value of investing in continuous household panel surveys where it is possible. If panel surveys are not feasible for a particular country, analysts and policy makers should at least bear in mind thatwhenyou survey people matters, both for data comparability over time, as well as for identifying who is in most need of particular programs and policies.These trends also underscore the importance of applying suitable methods for identifying social program beneficiaries that are able to distinguish
    those entrenched in poverty from those who are moving in and out of poverty. One common method is theProxy Means Test approach, which is designed to identify those who are chronically poor. However, when using this approach, there are potential estimation challenges, especially in contexts where many people move in and out of poverty on a regular basis.'
  summary: Poverty is often measured using repeated cross-sectional surveys that provide a snapshot of the poverty status of a given household at a particular point in time. Such designs call for interviewing different respondents in each round, and because individuals or households are only observed once, we cannot always tell whether ...

  content: 'Thinking about inequality is back in fashion! In its November 2013 outlook, the World Economic Forum called rising inequality the second biggest risk for 2014-15. The 2014 English translation of French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the 21stCentury” became an instant bestseller among academics and practitioners in both developed and developing countries. Discussions of inequality are popping up everywhere, and even seem to be setting the tone of many round tables and presentations in the World Bank Group’s upcoming Annual Meetings.


    Virtually all work on global inequality is based on compilations of household survey data, which as the work started by Piketty and co-authors demonstrate largely underestimate the actual value of income inequality. This is either because households tend to under-report income, especially on returns to financial assets, or because the rich are largely underrepresented in household surveys due to non-response bias as interviewers are often not allowed to pass through the security of gated communities..While this does not matter for poverty monitoring (which is only concerned with what is happening at the bottom end of the welfare distribution and is traditionally well captured by the existing household surveys), it does matter for inequality if there is evidence that there is a lot of action in the very top end of the distribution. In this case, measures of inequality based on household survey data, which are already high for some countries, would be even higher when incorporating the
    ‘invisible rich’, and could potentially affect inequality trends as we know them.Understanding what happening within this group of top income earners may also help to reconcile subjective perceptions of mobility and fairness in society with the reported objective measures of this phenomenon. In some regions such as Europe and Central Asia, there are puzzling divergent trends in observed inequality and economic mobility from household survey data and perceptions of inequality and economic mobility as reported from values and opinion surveys which might be explained by these “missing rich” from the household surveys.In this short blog post we would like share for your comments, reactions and views a few stylized facts from the Forbes Billionaires database from 1996 to 2014, which might be one of the very few data sources available for us take a peek at the very very very top of the income distribution:


    (1) Inequality between global billionaires is on the rise, as some billionaires are getting richer others are falling behind.


    (4) Results are extremely heterogeneous across regions, with East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America catching up with North America while Africa has continued to lag behind. This is trend is particularly driven by countries such as India, China, Russia, Ukraine and Brazil.


    (5)While inequality between billionaires is increasing overall, inequality between the country of citizenship of billionaires is declining, especially when compared to the mid 1990s. This seems to suggest that the opportunity of becoming a billionaire has been equalized, at least along the dimension of place of birth.'

    As mulheres estão se tornando progressivamente as parceiras mais importantes no desenvolvimento daAmérica Latina. Mães, estudantes, profissionais atuantes, mulheres de todas as origens são hoje a força motora da revolução de gênero que contribuiu de modo bastante significativo para a prosperidade de nossa região.


    Na última década, os países latino-americanos apresentaram um expressivo avanço na redução da pobreza e da desigualdade. Agora sabemos que uma grande parte desse progresso pode ser creditado às mulheres. Isto é tão verdadeiro que, se não houvesse tantas mulheres participando da força de trabalho, a pobreza extrema na região teria sido 30% maior em 2010. Algo semelhante pode ser dito sobre o recente progresso da região face à persistente desigualdade, como enfatiza o relatórioPoverty and Labor Brief: The Effect of Women’s Economic Power in Latin America and the Caribbean(Informe sobre Pobreza e Trabalho: O efeito do poder econômico das mulheres na América Latina e no Caribe).


    A questão mais importante não se refere ao aumento da mão de obra feminina nos anos 2000 – houve apenas uma relativa expansão modesta da sua participação na força de trabalho – mas sobretudo ao fato de que o seu rendimento aumentou de modo significativo, refletindo em grande parte o maior acesso das meninas à educação.


    Na maioria dos países latino-americanos, o percentual de meninas matriculadas na escola primária vem aumentando constantemente e o seu desempenho tem sido até melhor do que o dos meninos nos níveis médio e superior. A participação no mercado de trabalho também cresceu 15% em média entre 2000 e 2010 – graças ao maior investimento em capital humano, ao declínio da fertilidade e ao fato das mulheres estarem se casando mais tarde. No entanto, ainda persistem barreiras para que as mulheres possam expandir a sua contribuição econômica.


    Acreditamos que esses obstáculos possam ser enfrentados apenas com a implementação de políticas e programas criativos. Estas são algumas sugestões derivadas do nosso informe:


    - Criação de políticas diretas e indiretas para expandir as oportunidades das mulheres no conjunto da força de trabalho, com o objetivo de aumentar a sua participação e reduzir a disparidade de salários e a segmentação do mercado;


    - Melhoria da capacidade de decidir e de atuar das mulheres – ou seja, a sua habilidade de tomar decisões abalizadas. Embora esse fator seja intrinsecamente importante, também acarreta potenciais benefícios para a igualdade de oportunidades e de bens econômicos;


    - Apoio às famílias chefiadas por mulheres,  uma característica cada vez mais habitual nas sociedades latino-americanas.


    - Inclusão, quando for possível, de fortes sistemas de monitoramento e de avaliação para melhor identificar as iniciativas adequadas à promoção da igualdade de gêneros.


    As políticas voltadas para o mercado de trabalho se concentram normalmente na expansão dos serviços de formação vocacional e profissional, assim como de intermediação de emprego, visando ajudar as mulheres a se envolver em ocupações não tradicionais e encontrar melhores oportunidades de trabalho.


    Um estudo, a ser divulgado em breve, sugere que os programas de formação e de intermediação de emprego são os mais eficazes quando combinados às iniciativas destinadas a ampliar o empoderamento  feminino e a sua capacidade de atuação ou de tomar decisões como, por exemplo, o treinamento em competências pessoais e as interações com líderes feministas e com a comunidade.


    Na República Dominicana, por exemplo, os programas oferecem treinamento por meio de empregadores privados. Por sua vez, no Chile o projetoChile Califica(Chile Qualifica) estabeleceu provedores públicos para formação vocacional. No Haiti, a Iniciativa para Meninas Adolescentes tem como objetivo proporcionar formação em setores não tradicionais para jovens do sexo feminino por meio de diversas organizações não-governamentais, colocando-as posteriormente em estágios na iniciativa privada.


    Na Argentina, as mulheres de baixa renda recebem subsídios para formação e certificação profissional em determinadas competências. Também no Cone Sul, os programas de intermediação de emprego estão ajudando as mulheres a encontrar empregos mais qualificados.


    Melhoria do cuidado infantil


    Segundo o estudoWork and Family: Latin American women in search of a new balance. (Trabalho e Família: As mulheres latino-americanas buscam um novo equilíbrio), o melhor acesso aos cuidados infantis e as opções flexíveis de trabalho proporcionam outra possibilidade de expandir as oportunidades no mercado de trabalho feminino.


    Além disso,evidências do Rio de Janeiro, onde creches gratuitas foram oferecidas às mulheres pobres e vulneráveis, indicam que esses serviços podem melhorar as margens de participação (tanto o número de horas trabalhadas quanto a maior produtividade no emprego) e estimular ainda mais as mulheres a entrar no mercado de trabalho. Os formuladores de políticas não devem ignorar também “a outra metade do gênero”.


    Levar em consideração a função dos homens e dos meninos nos papéis e estereótipos de gênero representa um importante investimento na igualdade dos sexos. No Brasil, oInstitutoPromundorealizou um interessante trabalho nessa área. Embora as mulheres estejam ingressando cada vez mais na força de trabalho, as pesquisas de uso do tempo mostram que os homens ainda não têm uma participação suficiente nos afazeres domésticos e nos cuidados infantis, o que significa que uma dupla carga recai sobre as mulheres.


    Uma opção para os formuladores de políticas é aumentar a participação dos homens no cuidado infantil e no trabalho doméstico por meio de programas de licença paternidade e de promoção da educação conjunta dos filhos. Os governos devem considerar a implementação de programas de assistência e de gestão de risco dirigidos a esse grupo vulnerável.


    Estimular a capacidade de decidir e de atuar


    Não existe um conjunto de políticas para promover a capacidade de decidir e de atuar,  mas é importante começar a tratar esse tema como qualquer outro bem social, como a busca por uma boa saúde ou o acesso ao crédito, que pode ser cultivado e desenvolvido por meio de políticas e programas adequados.


    Políticas inteligentes poderão complementar as iniciativas tradicionais, incorporando elementos específicos focados na capacidade de decidir e de atuar. Um exemplo dessas novas linhas de ação de gênero é o projeto piloto da Nicarágua,Atención a Crisis. A iniciativa utiliza um programa comum de transferência condicional de renda para aumentar a base monetária e a capacidade de gestão de risco das famílias rurais pobres expostas a vulnerabilidades climáticas, como a seca. A ideia básica é simples, mas eficaz.


    Além dos pagamentos em dinheiro, um terço dos beneficiários – somente mulheres – recebe bolsas de estudo para formação vocacional. Outro terço foi contemplado com uma subvenção comercial e assistência técnica destinadas a investimentos produtivos em criação de gado e atividades não agrícolas.


    Os avaliadores do programa concluíramque as mulheres que receberam auxílio e trabalharam em atividades autônomas não agrícolas, duplicaram a sua renda (além dos ganhos auferidos com o programa), quando rodeadas por líderes que também receberam essa subvenção. Levando em conta o aumento das famílias chefiadas por mulheres, particularmente nas áreas urbanas, é importante elaborar projetos para apoiar esses segmentos vulneráveis.


    Até hoje, tem havido relativamente poucos programas direcionados a esse grupo. As áreas de ação propostas compreendem: programas de transferência condicional de renda para crianças de famílias chefiadas por mulheres; iniciativas de creches e pós-escolares de qualidade; monitoria para os filhos de mães que trabalham; apoio nutricional e educacional; e grupos de jovens.


    Por fim, é importante ampliar a base de conhecimento do que tem sido eficaz para promover uma maior igualdade de gêneros. O nossoDepartamento de Pobreza, Gênero e Equidadelançará em breve uma Iniciativa de Avaliação do Impacto de Gênero, com o objetivo de preencher as lacunas no conhecimento de políticas e intervenções em prol da equidade de bens, oportunidades econômicas e capacidade de atuação.


    As avaliações identificarão as principais políticas e as condições iniciais para diferenciar o que funciona ou não, e as pessoas a quem se destinam, visando promover melhorias na igualdade de gêneros.'

    Women are increasingly becomingLatin America''scritical development partners. Moms, students, working professionals, women from all walks of life, are a driving force behind a gender revolution that has made huge contributions to our region''s prosperity.


    Over the last decade, Latin American countries have made big strides in reducing poverty and bringing down inequality. And much of that progress, we now know, can be credited to women. So much so that, had there not been so many women in the workforce, extreme poverty in the region in 2010 would have been 30 percent higher. Something similar can be said about the region''s recent inroads against persistent inequality, as highlighted inPoverty and Labor Brief: The Effect of Women''s Economic Power in Latin America and the Caribbean.


    It is not so much that female labor force participation increased in the 2000s -- there was only a relatively modest expansion of women in the workforce. But rather their returns to labor grew significantly, in large part reflecting girls'' expanded access to education.


    In most Latin American countries, the percentage of girls enrolled in primary school has been steadily catching up and they''re even outperforming boys at secondary and tertiary levels. Labor market participation has also grown by 15 percent on average between 2000 and 2010 —thanks to greater investments in human capital, fertility declines and women marrying later in life. Yet, for women wishing to expand their economic contribution, barriers still persist.


    - Direct and indirect policies to expand female labor market opportunities, to increase labor force participation and reduce the wage gap and labor market segmentation;


    - Improve female ''agency'' –that is, their ability to make informed decisions. Expected to be important in its own right, this also carries potential benefits for equality of economic opportunities and assets;


    - Support families from single female-headed households, a growing fixture in Latin American societies.


    - Include, when possible, strong monitoring and evaluation systems to better identify initiatives that work to promote gender equality.


    An upcoming study suggests that training and job intermediation programs are most effective when combined with initiatives designed to expand female empowerment and their decision making capabilities (or agency), such as soft-skills training, interactions with female leaders and the community.


    For example, programs in the Dominican Republic provide training through private sector employers. Meanwhile in Chile, Chile Califica, has established public-sector providers of vocational training. And in Haiti, the Adolescent Girls Initiative is procuring training in non-traditional sectors to young women through a variety of NGOs and then placing them in internships in the private sector.


    In Argentina, women on low incomes are given subsidies for professional training and certification in certain skills. Job intermediation programs, also in the Southern Cone, are helping women find higher quality employment.


    Improved access to childcare and flexible work options offer another avenue to expand female labor market opportunities, according to the studyWork and Family: Latin American women in search of a new balance.


    Furthermore,evidence from Rio de Janeirowhere poor and vulnerable mothers were offered free daycare, indicates that such services can improve participation margins (the number of hours worked or sorting into higher productivity jobs), more than encouraging women to enter the workforce. Policy makers should also not ignore "the other half of gender".


    Addressing the role of men and boys in gender roles and stereotypes is an important investment into gender equality. Brazil''sInstituto Promundohas done interesting work in this area. While women have increasingly entered the labor force, time-use surveys show that men still do not sufficiently participate in domestic and care work, meaning that women carry a double burden.


    One option for policy makers is to increase men''s participation in childcare and housework through parental leave policies and the promotion of joint parenting. Governments should consider introducing targeted risk management programs and assistance programs to this vulnerable group.


    There is no one set of policies to promote ''agency'' but it''s important to start treating it like any other social assets (such as good health or access to credit) which can be nurtured and developed through good policies and programs.


    Smart policies will complement initiatives of the traditional sort, by incorporating specific elements to target ''agency''. An example of this new breed of gender policies is Nicaragua''s pilot Atención a Crisis. It uses traditional Conditional Cash Transfer program (CCT) to increase the asset base and risk management capacity of rural poor households exposed to weather risks, such as drought. Its core idea is quite simple but effective.


    In addition to receiving cash payments, one-third of the beneficiaries (just women) received vocational training scholarships. Another third received a business grant and technical assistance for productive investments in livestock or non-agricultural activities.


    Evaluators foundthat women who received grants and worked in non-agricultural self-employment, doubled their income (on top of the gains from the program itself) when surrounded by leaders who had also received such grant. Given the increase in female single-headed households, particularly in urban areas, it is important to design programs to support these vulnerable households.


    To date, there have been relatively few programs targeting this group.
