  abstract: This paper presents simulations of the potential effect of COVID-19-related school closures on schooling and learning outcomes. It considers four scenarios—varying in both the duration of school
    closures and the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies being deployed by governments. Using data on 174 countries, the analysis finds that the global level of schooling and learning will fall substantially.
    School closures could result in a loss of between 0.3 and 1.1 years of schooling adjusted for

  abstract: "In the mid-2000s, poverty measurement in\r\n            Colombia was at a standstill. A dated poverty measurement\r\n            methodology was clashing with improvements in the national\r\
