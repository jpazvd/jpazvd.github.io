# Production Gemfile for GitHub Pages native build
# Keep this minimal and ONLY include plugins supported by GitHub Pages.

# Meta gem that pins Jekyll and the supported plugins to the exact versions
# used by GitHub Pages' build environment.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# For local development with full bibliography support, use scripts/bootstrap-jekyll.ps1
# which generates a separate Gemfile.local and should not affect production.
