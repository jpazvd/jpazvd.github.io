My research is driven by a commitment to using data and evidence to improve the lives of children and vulnerable populations globally. Spanning over two decades at institutions like UNICEF, the World Bank, and in the Brazilian public sector, my work focuses on the intersection of development economics, education policy, and poverty analysis.

I specialize in measuring and diagnosing development challenges, evaluating the policies designed to address them, and building the statistical capacity of systems to support evidence-based policymaking. A significant portion of my recent work has centered on creating global public goods, such as the Learning Poverty measure, and assessing the profound impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on education and intergenerational mobility.

## Core Research Agendas

<div class="research-section" markdown="1">

### 1. Child Wellbeing, Poverty, and Equity

This agenda focuses on the multidimensional aspects of child poverty and wellbeing. It includes developing frameworks for monitoring progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for children, analyzing the drivers of inequality, and investigating the determinants of child health and mortality.

### 2. Education, Learning, and Human Capital

This is a central pillar of my research, with a focus on ensuring quality education for all. This work involves measuring educational outcomes, diagnosing inequalities in learning, and evaluating the impact of educational interventions and global shocks.

#### Sub-theme: Learning Poverty and Foundational Skills

A core contribution of my work at the World Bank was the co-creation of the global "Learning Poverty" indicator—a measure of the percentage of children unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10. This research stream involves the harmonization of learning assessments and the analysis of policies to accelerate progress in foundational learning.

#### Sub-theme: The Educational Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

In response to the global crisis, I led research to simulate and measure the impact of school closures on learning outcomes. This work quantified the scale of "learning losses," analyzed the effectiveness of remote learning strategies, and informed global education recovery efforts.

### 3. Data Systems, Methods, and Statistical Capacity

Underpinning all my research is a focus on improving the data and methods we use to measure development. This includes strengthening national statistical systems, developing new econometric tools, and making data more accessible and useful for policymakers and researchers.

#### Sub-theme: Data for Policy and Global Monitoring

This work focuses on building evidence-to-policy pipelines, from the global harmonization of household surveys for poverty monitoring to the development of data compacts that align countries and partners around common measurement goals.
