I am [UNICEF’s first Chief Statistician](https://www.unicef.org/media/experts/joao-pedro-azevedo), appointed in February 2023 to lead the organization’s global data and statistical work. Before joining UNICEF, I worked for 16 years at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/j/joao-pedro-azevedo), as Lead Economist of the Poverty and Equity Practice and Education Global Practice, where I had several roles such as EdTech Fellow, Education Statistics Coordinator, and Global Lead, co-leading the Global Solution Group on Welfare Measurement and Statistical Capacity for Results, as well as the Data for Goals agenda. Before my tenure at the World Bank, I served as the superintendent of Monitoring and Evaluation at the [Secretary of Finance for the State of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.fazenda.rj.gov.br/), as well as a research fellow at the [Institute of Applied Economic Research](https://ipea.gov.br) from the Brazilian Ministry of Planning (IPEA) in Rio de Janeiro. 

Most of my publications can be found listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lTKXA78AAAAJ) or at the [World Bank Open Knowledge Repository](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/person/360f7a2e-0784-56e1-acf4-7f805fd50257). A full list of my Stata ado is available at the [Boston College Statistical Software Components](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pwa88.html).

I am a Brazilian national and hold a PhD in Economics from Newcastle University. I have over 70 publications including several in referred journals such as Lancet, World Development, World Bank Research Observer and Frontier in Public Health. I am married and a father of twin daughters.
